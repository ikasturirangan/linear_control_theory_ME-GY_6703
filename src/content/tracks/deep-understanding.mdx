# Deep Understanding Path

This path is slower and more rigorous.
It focuses on building intuition first, then abstraction, then design.

## Execution strategy

- After each page, write a 3-sentence explanation in your own words.
- Use retrieval cycles: study -> close notes -> explain from memory -> check gaps.
- For each formula, identify physical meaning of every term.
- Use [Common Mistakes](/reference/mistakes) to challenge your own assumptions.
