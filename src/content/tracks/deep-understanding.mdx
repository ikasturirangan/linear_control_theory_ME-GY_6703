# Deep Understanding Path

This path is slower and more rigorous.
It focuses on building intuition plus mathematical structure.

## Sequence

1. [Initialize Syllabus Tracker](/syllabus/progress-tracker)
2. Entire [Absolute Basics](/basics/anatomy)
3. [Interactive Step and Pole Sliders](/interactive/step-and-poles)
4. [Modeling and Transfer Functions](/fundamentals)
5. [First vs Second Order Behavior](/fundamentals/first-second-order)
6. [Frequency Response and Bode Plots](/fundamentals/frequency-response-bode)
7. [Interactive Bode Lab](/interactive/bode-plot-lab)
8. [State-Space Methods](/state-space)
9. [Stability and Performance](/stability)
10. Work every [Worked Example](/worked-examples)
11. Attempt all [Practice Sets](/practice) before answer key

## Execution strategy

- After each page, write a 3-sentence explanation in your own words.
- For each formula, identify physical meaning of every term.
- Use [Common Mistakes](/reference/mistakes) to challenge your own assumptions.
