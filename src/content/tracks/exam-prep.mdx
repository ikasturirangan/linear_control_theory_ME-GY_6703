# Exam Prep Path

This path prioritizes likely exam question formats and quick retrieval.
It uses short learning blocks + frequent recall for better retention under time pressure.

## Sequence

1. [Initialize Syllabus Tracker](/syllabus/progress-tracker)
2. [Anatomy of a Control System](/basics/anatomy)
3. [Block Diagrams Chapter](/block-diagrams)
4. [Transfer Functions for Absolute Beginners](/fundamentals/transfer-functions-beginner)
5. [Poles, Zeros, DC Gain, Relative Degree](/fundamentals/poles-zeros-dc-gain-relative-degree)
6. [First vs Second Order Behavior](/fundamentals/first-second-order)
7. [Stability and Performance](/stability)
8. [Frequency Response and Bode Plots](/fundamentals/frequency-response-bode)
9. [State-Space Methods](/state-space)
10. [Worked Examples](/worked-examples)
11. [Practice Sets](/practice)
12. [Detailed Syllabus](/syllabus)

## Execution strategy

- Use a 2:1 pattern: 2 concept pages, then 1 practice block.
- Spend 70% time on solved examples + practice.
- Use [Symbols and Units](/reference/symbols) during drills.
- Use [Common Mistakes](/reference/mistakes) as final checklist.
