# Stability and Performance

In linear control, closed-loop pole locations are the first stability checkpoint.
For continuous-time systems, poles in the open left-half plane imply asymptotic stability.

## Second-order intuition

For the standard form:

<EquationHelp hint="This closed-loop template is the reference model for most transient-response metrics. Compare your denominator to read zeta and wn directly.">

$$
G_{cl}(s) = \frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2 \zeta \omega_n s + \omega_n^2}
$$

</EquationHelp>

- $\zeta$ controls overshoot and oscillation
- $\omega_n$ controls overall speed of response

Approximate metrics:

<EquationHelp hint="Percent overshoot is strongly tied to damping ratio. Smaller zeta means a larger exponential term and more overshoot.">

$$
M_p \approx e^{-\pi \zeta / \sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} \times 100\%
$$

</EquationHelp>

<EquationHelp hint="This estimate captures a key design tradeoff: faster settling usually needs larger zeta*wn, often via higher bandwidth and damping.">

$$
T_s \approx \frac{4}{\zeta \omega_n}
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Root locus and frequency tools

- Root locus: tracks pole migration as gain changes
- Bode/Nyquist: show gain-phase tradeoffs and robustness margins

## Bode focus (syllabus connection)

Bode plots are part of the core stability syllabus because they expose robustness directly.
Use them to estimate:

- Crossover frequency (speed tendency)
- Phase margin (damping/oscillation tendency)
- High-frequency roll-off (noise amplification tendency)

Go to [Frequency Response and Bode Plots](/fundamentals/frequency-response-bode) for full walkthrough and [Bode Plot Lab](/interactive/bode-plot-lab) for sliders.
For full syllabus sequence, continue through [Module 3.3](/syllabus/3-3-bode-relative-stability) to [Module 3.5](/syllabus/3-5-routh-nyquist).
If you want one combined map of step, Bode, and Nyquist viewpoints, read [Step vs Bode vs Nyquist (Detailed Comparison)](/fundamentals/step-bode-nyquist-comparison).

## Practice prompt

For a unity-feedback plant $G(s)$, estimate a gain range that keeps
all closed-loop poles in the left-half plane, then predict overshoot trends as gain increases.
