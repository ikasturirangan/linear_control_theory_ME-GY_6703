# Symbols and Units

Use this sheet as the default notation unless a problem states otherwise.

## Core loop signals

| Symbol | Meaning | Typical Unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $r(t)$ | Reference (target) | same as output (degC, m/s, rad) |
| $y(t)$ | Output (measured reality) | process unit |
| $e(t)=r(t)-y(t)$ | Error | same as output |
| $u(t)$ | Control effort/command | V, N, torque, valve % |

## Common dynamic parameters

| Symbol | Meaning | Typical Unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $K$ | Gain | depends on signal scaling |
| $\tau$ | Time constant | s |
| $\zeta$ | Damping ratio | dimensionless |
| $\omega_n$ | Natural frequency | rad/s |
| $T_s$ | Settling time | s |
| $M_p$ | Percent overshoot | % |

## State-space notation

| Symbol | Meaning | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $x(t)$ | State vector | $n\times1$ |
| $u(t)$ | Input vector | $m\times1$ |
| $y(t)$ | Output vector | $p\times1$ |
| $A$ | State matrix | $n\times n$ |
| $B$ | Input matrix | $n\times m$ |
| $C$ | Output matrix | $p\times n$ |
| $D$ | Feedthrough matrix | $p\times m$ |

## Sign convention

Default for this site is negative feedback:

$$
e(t)=r(t)-y(t)
$$

Always check the summing-node signs before deriving equations.
