# Visual Comparisons

## Open-loop vs Closed-loop

<OpenLoopDiagram

| Aspect | Open-loop | Closed-loop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Disturbance handling | Weak | Stronger |
| Complexity | Lower | Higher |
| Accuracy | Lower | Higher (if tuned well) |

## Stable vs Marginal vs Unstable

| Condition | Pole location (continuous) | Typical time response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stable | Real parts negative | Decays and settles |
| Marginal | On imaginary axis (special cases) | Sustained oscillation/no decay |
| Unstable | Any real part positive | Diverges |

Use [Step Response and Pole Sliders](/interactive/step-and-poles) to see this behavior directly.

## Fast vs Robust Tradeoff

| Design direction | Typical effect |
| --- | --- |
| Increase crossover/gain | Faster response, often reduced margin |
| Increase phase margin | More robust/damped, often slower response |
| Aggressive derivative action | Faster phase lift but noise sensitivity risk |
