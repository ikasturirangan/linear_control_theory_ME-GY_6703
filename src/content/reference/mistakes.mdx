# Common Mistakes

## 1. Wrong feedback sign

Using $e=y-r$ instead of $e=r-y$ without checking diagram sign.
This can invert controller action.

## 2. Confusing controller and actuator

Controller computes command; actuator applies physical effort.
Mixing these breaks block-diagram interpretation.

## 3. Ignoring units

You can subtract $r$ and $y$ only if they share units.
Also, $u$ can have different units from output.

## 4. Assuming linearity everywhere

A linear model is usually local.
Saturation, friction, and dead zones can dominate away from operating point.

## 5. Misreading pole locations

For continuous time, stability depends on pole real parts, not magnitudes.
Right-half plane poles imply instability.

## 6. Forgetting initial-condition assumptions

Transfer-function derivation typically assumes zero initial conditions.
If initial conditions are nonzero, response includes extra terms.

## 7. Rank check errors in state-space

Students often compute $AB$ or $CA$ incorrectly and then conclude wrong controllability/observability.
Show matrix multiplication explicitly.

## 8. Tuning for speed only

Pushing bandwidth without damping/robustness checks can cause oscillation and poor disturbance tolerance.
