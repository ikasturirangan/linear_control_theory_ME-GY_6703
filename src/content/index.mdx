# Welcome

This site is a structured learning path for linear control theory.
It is designed for fast revision, exam prep, and deep understanding.

## What is inside

- A complete [Detailed Syllabus](/syllabus) with module-by-module notes
- Built-in [Progress Tracker](/syllabus/progress-tracker) for all syllabus units
- Mental models in **Absolute Basics**
- Transfer-function and order-based intuition in **Fundamentals**
- Frequency response with **Bode plots**
- State-space and rank tests
- Stability metrics and pole-based reasoning
- Fully solved worked examples
- Practice sets with one shared answer key
- Global symbols/units and common mistakes reference
- Interactive sliders for step response, pole movement, and Bode plots
- Two learning tracks (exam-prep vs deep understanding)
