title: Linear Control Theory for Students
description: A guided set of notes to help you learn linear control theory step by step.
---

# Welcome

This site is organized for **first-time learners** of linear control theory.
The chapter order is designed to reduce overload and improve long-term retention.

## Why this order works

- **Concrete to abstract**: physical intuition before equations.
- **Scaffolding**: each chapter assumes only the previous one.
- **Chunking**: topics grouped into small, coherent units.
- **Retrieval practice**: frequent worked examples and practice sets.
- **Spaced review**: concepts revisited in later chapters (not one-and-done).

## Psychology-backed first pass

1. **Phase 0 (setup)**:
   [Progress Tracker](/syllabus/progress-tracker), [Short Forms Index](/syllabus/short-forms-index)
2. **Phase 1 (mental models)**:
   [Absolute Basics](/basics/anatomy), [Block Diagrams Chapter](/block-diagrams)
3. **Phase 2 (core language)**:
   [Transfer Functions for Absolute Beginners](/fundamentals/transfer-functions-beginner),
   [Poles, Zeros, DC Gain, Relative Degree](/fundamentals/poles-zeros-dc-gain-relative-degree),
   [Fundamentals](/fundamentals)
4. **Phase 3 (math origins companion)**:
   [Math Origins](/math-origins) for derivation-first explanations behind each syllabus topic
5. **Phase 4 (behavior and robustness)**:
   [Interactive Plots](/interactive),
   [Stability and Performance](/stability),
   [Frequency Response and Bode](/fundamentals/frequency-response-bode)
6. **Phase 5 (modern representation)**:
   [State-Space Methods](/state-space)
7. **Phase 6 (retrieval and transfer)**:
   [Worked Examples](/worked-examples), [Practice Sets](/practice), [Reference Sheets](/reference)
8. **Phase 7 (full syllabus completion)**:
   [Detailed Syllabus](/syllabus)

## Weekly study pattern (recommended)

1. Learn one concept page.
2. Do one worked example.
3. Attempt one practice set without notes.
4. Review mistakes and short forms.
