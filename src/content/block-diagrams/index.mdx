# Block Diagrams Chapter

This chapter teaches you how control engineers think visually.
If you can draw a correct block diagram, control math becomes easier.

## What you will learn

1. What each block and arrow means.
2. How to map a real system to diagram form.
3. How to include command, feedback, and disturbance paths.
4. How to check whether your drawing is physically meaningful.

## Suggested order

1. [Understanding Block Diagrams](/block-diagrams/understanding-block-diagrams)
2. [How to Draw Block Diagrams](/block-diagrams/drawing-workflow)
3. [Block Diagrams for Different Systems](/block-diagrams/different-systems-examples)
4. [Practice Drawing and Checking](/block-diagrams/practice-drawing)

## Why this chapter comes early

Before transfer functions and stability methods, you need a clear map of signal flow.
Block diagrams are that map.
