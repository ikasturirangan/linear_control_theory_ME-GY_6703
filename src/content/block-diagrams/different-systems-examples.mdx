# Block Diagrams for Different Systems

Below are beginner-friendly examples from different domains.

## Example 1: Room temperature control (thermostat)

<ClosedLoopDiagram
  caption="Room temperature control loop"
  disturbanceLabel="Outside weather disturbance"
  errorLabel="e"
  forwardBlocks={["Thermostat Controller", "Heater + Room"]}
  outputLabel="T_room"
  referenceLabel="T_ref"
  sensorLabel="Temp Sensor"
/>

What to notice:

- Disturbance is heat loss/gain from environment.
- Sensor is temperature measurement.

## Example 2: DC motor speed control

<ClosedLoopDiagram
  caption="DC motor speed control loop"
  disturbanceLabel="Load torque disturbance"
  errorLabel="e"
  forwardBlocks={["Speed Controller", "Motor + Driver"]}
  outputLabel="omega"
  referenceLabel="omega_ref"
  sensorLabel="Encoder"
/>

What to notice:

- Load torque disturbance changes speed even with same input.
- Feedback reduces speed error under load changes.

## Example 3: Tank level control

<ClosedLoopDiagram
  caption="Tank level control loop"
  disturbanceLabel="Outlet flow disturbance"
  errorLabel="e"
  forwardBlocks={["Level Controller", "Valve + Tank Dynamics"]}
  outputLabel="h"
  referenceLabel="h_ref"
  sensorLabel="Level Sensor"
/>

What to notice:

- Process is fluid accumulation dynamics.
- Disturbance often enters through outlet demand changes.

## Example 4: Cruise control (vehicle speed)

<ClosedLoopDiagram
  caption="Cruise control loop"
  disturbanceLabel="Road slope and wind drag"
  errorLabel="e"
  forwardBlocks={["Cruise Controller", "Engine + Vehicle"]}
  outputLabel="v"
  referenceLabel="v_ref"
  sensorLabel="Speed Sensor"
/>

What to notice:

- Slope and drag are classic disturbances.
- Controller adjusts throttle effort to maintain speed.

## Example 5: Digital control architecture

<ClosedLoopDiagram
  caption="Digital control architecture"
  errorLabel="e[k]"
  forwardBlocks={["Digital Controller C(z)", "DAC + ZOH + Plant"]}
  outputLabel="y(t)"
  referenceLabel="r[k]"
  sensorLabel="Sensor + ADC"
/>

What to notice:

- Controller is discrete (`k` index), plant is often continuous (`t`).
- ADC/DAC/ZOH are explicit interface blocks.

## Cross-example pattern

All five examples share same skeleton:

- reference -> error -> controller -> plant -> output -> sensor -> feedback

Only block meaning and disturbance location change by domain.
