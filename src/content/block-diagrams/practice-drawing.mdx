# Practice Drawing and Checking

Use these prompts without looking at example solutions first.

## Why This Matters

Drawing skill only improves through repeated retrieval and correction, not passive reading.

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic block symbols and loop anatomy
- Signal labels (`r,e,u,y`)

## Learning Outcomes

1. Draw valid diagrams from word problems.
2. Place disturbances at physically correct points.
3. Self-check diagrams before equation derivation.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Self-check rubric | Quality checklist for diagram validity |
| Disturbance entry | Physical point where external effect enters |
| Controller/plant separation | Distinction between decision and dynamics |

## Exercise A: Drone altitude hold

System description:

- User gives desired altitude.
- Flight controller computes thrust command.
- Barometer/IMU estimate altitude.
- Wind gust acts as disturbance.

Tasks:

1. Draw full feedback loop.
2. Mark disturbance entry location.
3. Label `r`, `e`, `u`, `y`.

## Exercise B: Conveyor belt speed control

System description:

- Desired belt speed is set by operator.
- Motor driver receives command voltage.
- Tachometer measures actual speed.
- Added package mass causes speed droop.

Tasks:

1. Draw block diagram.
2. Decide what belongs inside plant block.
3. Mark external disturbance.

## Exercise C: Chemical reactor temperature control

System description:

- Setpoint is reactor temperature.
- Control input is coolant valve position.
- Sensor measures reactor temperature.
- Feed concentration variation disturbs heat generation.

Tasks:

1. Draw loop with disturbance.
2. Decide where disturbance enters (controller or plant?) and justify.

## Self-check rubric

Give yourself 1 point each:

1. Correct feedback sign at summing node.
2. Clear plant/controller/sensor separation.
3. Disturbance enters physically correct location.
4. Signals are labeled and directional.
5. Diagram can be converted into equations.

Score guide:

- 5/5: solid
- 3-4/5: review workflow
- 0-2/5: revisit examples page

## Continue

After this chapter, go to [Block Diagram Algebra](/basics/block-diagram-algebra) to reduce diagrams into transfer functions.

## Detailed Review

1. Which rubric criteria were hardest in your attempts?
2. Did you place disturbances based on physics or guesswork?
3. Can your diagrams be translated to equations without ambiguity?

## Assignments

1. Create two additional custom prompts from real systems and solve them.
2. Exchange diagrams with a peer and grade each other with the rubric.
