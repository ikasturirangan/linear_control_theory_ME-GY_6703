# Practice Drawing and Checking

Use these prompts without looking at example solutions first.

## Exercise A: Drone altitude hold

System description:

- User gives desired altitude.
- Flight controller computes thrust command.
- Barometer/IMU estimate altitude.
- Wind gust acts as disturbance.

Tasks:

1. Draw full feedback loop.
2. Mark disturbance entry location.
3. Label `r`, `e`, `u`, `y`.

## Exercise B: Conveyor belt speed control

System description:

- Desired belt speed is set by operator.
- Motor driver receives command voltage.
- Tachometer measures actual speed.
- Added package mass causes speed droop.

Tasks:

1. Draw block diagram.
2. Decide what belongs inside plant block.
3. Mark external disturbance.

## Exercise C: Chemical reactor temperature control

System description:

- Setpoint is reactor temperature.
- Control input is coolant valve position.
- Sensor measures reactor temperature.
- Feed concentration variation disturbs heat generation.

Tasks:

1. Draw loop with disturbance.
2. Decide where disturbance enters (controller or plant?) and justify.

## Self-check rubric

Give yourself 1 point each:

1. Correct feedback sign at summing node.
2. Clear plant/controller/sensor separation.
3. Disturbance enters physically correct location.
4. Signals are labeled and directional.
5. Diagram can be converted into equations.

Score guide:

- 5/5: solid
- 3-4/5: review workflow
- 0-2/5: revisit examples page
