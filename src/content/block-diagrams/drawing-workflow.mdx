# How to Draw Block Diagrams

Use this workflow every time you face a new system.

## Step 1: Define control objective

Write one clear sentence:

- "Maintain room temperature at setpoint."
- "Track desired motor speed."

If objective is unclear, diagram will be unclear.

## Step 2: Identify the 4 anatomy blocks

From the physical setup, identify:

- Plant
- Sensor
- Controller
- Actuator

## Step 3: Choose primary signals

At minimum define:

- `r(t)` reference
- `y(t)` output
- `e(t)=r(t)-y(t)` error
- `u(t)` control input to plant/actuator

## Step 4: Draw forward path

Typical order:

`e(t) -> controller -> actuator -> plant -> y(t)`

## Step 5: Add feedback path

Route measured output through sensor block back to the negative input of summing node.

## Step 6: Add disturbance path (if relevant)

If external disturbances exist (load torque, wind, heat loss), add disturbance input at the correct physical entry point.

## Step 7: Sanity-check your diagram

Checklist:

1. Are units consistent at each summing node?
2. Does disturbance enter where physics says it should?
3. Does feedback use measured output, not desired output?
4. Can each block be described by an equation/model?

## Template you can reuse

<ClosedLoopDiagram

  errorLabel="e(t)"
  forwardBlocks={["C(s)", "G(s)"]}
  sensorLabel="H(s)"
