# How to Draw Block Diagrams

Use this workflow every time you face a new system.

## Why This Matters

Drawing the correct diagram first prevents major modeling and controller-design mistakes later.

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic block symbols
- Negative-feedback sign convention

## Learning Outcomes

1. Build a full control loop diagram from verbal system description.
2. Place disturbance inputs at physically correct locations.
3. Perform a sanity check before deriving equations.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Forward path | Controller/actuator/plant path from error to output |
| Feedback path | Sensor path returning output information |
| Disturbance input | External non-command influence on system |
| Sanity check | Quick structural validity test before analysis |

## Step 1: Define control objective

Write one clear sentence:

- "Maintain room temperature at setpoint."
- "Track desired motor speed."

If objective is unclear, diagram will be unclear.

## Step 2: Identify the 4 anatomy blocks

From the physical setup, identify:

- Plant
- Sensor
- Controller
- Actuator

## Step 3: Choose primary signals

At minimum define:

- `r(t)` reference
- `y(t)` output
- `e(t)=r(t)-y(t)` error
- `u(t)` control input to plant/actuator

## Step 4: Draw forward path

Typical order:

`e(t) -> controller -> actuator -> plant -> y(t)`

## Step 5: Add feedback path

Route measured output through sensor block back to the negative input of summing node.

## Step 6: Add disturbance path (if relevant)

If external disturbances exist (load torque, wind, heat loss), add disturbance input at the correct physical entry point.

## Step 7: Sanity-check your diagram

Checklist:

1. Are units consistent at each summing node?
2. Does disturbance enter where physics says it should?
3. Does feedback use measured output, not desired output?
4. Can each block be described by an equation/model?

## Template you can reuse

<ClosedLoopDiagram

  errorLabel="e(t)"
  forwardBlocks={["C(s)", "G(s)"]}
  sensorLabel="H(s)"

See concrete examples in [Block Diagrams for Different Systems](/block-diagrams/different-systems-examples).

## Detailed Review

1. Why must block-diagram structure follow physical causality?
2. Why is disturbance location not arbitrary?
3. Why should equation derivation wait until diagram sanity check passes?

## Assignments

1. Draw loops for one thermal and one mechanical system with disturbance paths.
2. Run the 4-point sanity checklist on both diagrams.
