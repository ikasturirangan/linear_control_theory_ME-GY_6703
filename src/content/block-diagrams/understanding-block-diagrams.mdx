# Understanding Block Diagrams

## What is a block diagram?

A block diagram is a simplified signal-flow map of a control system.
It shows what information moves where, and what transformation happens at each step.

## Core symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Beginner interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[ G ]` | Dynamic block | A component that transforms input signal into output signal |
| Arrow | Signal direction | Which way information flows |
| `( + / - )` node | Summing junction | Adds/subtracts signals (often forms error) |
| Split node | Branch point | One signal feeding multiple destinations |

## Canonical feedback structure

## Signal meaning in this diagram

- `r(t)`: reference (goal)
- `y(t)`: measured output (reality)
- `e(t)=r(t)-y(t)`: error
- controller output: control effort sent to actuator/plant

## Mental model

Read left-to-right:

1. compare goal and reality,
2. compute action,
3. apply action to plant,
4. measure result,
5. repeat.

## Common confusion to avoid

- A block is not necessarily one physical device; it can represent a combined subsystem.
- A line is not electrical wire specifically; it means "signal path".
- Diagram simplification is normal. It captures relevant dynamics, not every hardware detail.
