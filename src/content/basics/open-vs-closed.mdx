# Open Loop vs. Closed Loop

Feedback is the most important word in control theory.
It separates "send a command and hope" from "measure and correct."
Use the two block diagrams below as your visual anchor.

<OpenLoopDiagram
  caption="Block Diagram 2: Open Loop"
  blocks={["Controller", "Actuator", "Plant"]}
/>

No measured output is sent back to the controller.

<ClosedLoopDiagram

  forwardBlocks={["Controller", "Actuator", "Plant"]}
  sensorLabel="Sensor"
/>

## Open Loop

You give a command and do not check whether the result was right.
This is Block Diagram 2.

Example: a toaster.
You set a time and wait.
It does not know whether the bread is pale or burnt.

### Why engineers still use it

- Simple
- Cheap
- Easy to implement

### Core weakness

It cannot correct disturbances or model mismatch.

If line voltage changes, bread thickness changes, or room temperature changes, the controller does nothing about it.

## Closed Loop (Feedback)

You measure output, compute error, and adjust in real time.
This is Block Diagram 3, where measured output returns to the input summing node.

Example: a thermostat.
It checks room temperature and keeps heating until target temperature is reached.

### Why it is powerful

- Rejects disturbances
- Corrects mismatch between model and reality
- Usually more accurate

### Tradeoff

More sensors, design effort, and tuning are required.

## Side-by-side comparison

| Question | Open Loop | Closed Loop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Uses measured output? | No | Yes |
| Handles disturbances well? | Poorly | Much better |
| Implementation complexity | Lower | Higher |
| Typical accuracy | Lower | Higher |

## Important nuance

Feedback is not "always better" automatically.
Badly tuned feedback can oscillate or even become unstable.
So closed-loop control gives more power, but also more responsibility in design.
Block Diagram 3 adds capability, but tuning determines whether that capability is used well.

## Rule of thumb for beginners

If performance matters and disturbances exist, you almost always want feedback.

## Check yourself

Classify each as open or closed loop:

1. Sprinkler on a fixed timer.
2. Robot arm using encoder feedback.
3. Oven heater with only a countdown knob.
