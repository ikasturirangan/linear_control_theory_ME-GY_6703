# Anatomy of a Control System

Everything from a toilet tank to an autopilot follows the same anatomy.
Before equations, memorize this loop.
Refer to Block Diagram 1 throughout this page.

## Why This Matters

If you cannot identify plant/sensor/controller/actuator, later equations become disconnected symbols.

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic idea of a system input and output
- Difference between desired target and measured reality

## Learning Outcomes

By the end, you should be able to:

1. Identify plant, sensor, controller, and actuator in real systems.
2. Explain each block's role in one sentence.
3. Map a verbal system description to a closed-loop diagram.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Plant | Physical process being controlled |
| Sensor | Device/system estimating measured output |
| Controller | Logic/mathematics computing corrective action |
| Actuator | Physical mechanism applying control effort |
| Feedback loop | Repeated measurement and correction cycle |

If you can identify these parts in any problem, you are already thinking like a control engineer.

## The Plant (The Body)

The plant is the physical process you want to influence.
It is "the thing with dynamics."
In Block Diagram 1, this is the `[ Plant P ]` block.

Examples:

- A motor shaft angle
- The temperature of a room
- The altitude of a drone

Question the plant answers:
"What physical quantity changes over time?"

## The Sensor (The Eyes)

The sensor measures what is actually happening in the plant.
Without a sensor, you are guessing.
In Block Diagram 1, this is `[ Sensor H ]` in the feedback path.

Examples:

- Thermometer
- Encoder
- GPS + IMU

Question the sensor answers:
"What is the system really doing right now?"

## The Controller (The Brain)

The controller compares goal vs reality and computes the next command.
This is where the control law (P, PI, PID, state feedback, etc.) lives.
In Block Diagram 1, this is `[ Controller C ]` right after the summing node.

Examples:

- On/off thermostat logic
- PID equation
- State-feedback law

Question the controller answers:
"Given the error, what should we do next?"

## The Actuator (The Muscle)

The actuator takes the controller command and pushes on the real world.
In Block Diagram 1, this is `[ Actuator A ]`, between controller and plant.

Examples:

- Motor torque
- Heater power
- Valve opening

Question the actuator answers:
"How do we physically inject effort into the plant?"

## One fast example: cruise control

- Plant: vehicle speed dynamics
- Sensor: wheel speed sensor
- Controller: speed control logic in ECU
- Actuator: throttle command (or motor torque in EVs)

If the car slows down on a hill, the sensor detects drop in speed, controller increases command, actuator pushes harder, and speed returns.
That sequence is exactly the loop shown in Block Diagram 1.

## Common confusion

Controller vs actuator:

- Controller decides effort
- Actuator delivers effort

Software is usually controller.
Hardware that moves energy is usually actuator.

## Mental model to keep forever

The loop is simple:

1. Measure reality
2. Compare with goal
3. Decide action
4. Push the plant

Repeat continuously.

## Check yourself

For a home AC thermostat system, identify:

- Plant
- Sensor
- Controller
- Actuator

## Detailed Review

Before moving on, check you can:

1. Distinguish controller decision from actuator effort.
2. Explain why sensor quality affects control performance.
3. Identify one disturbance for each of two real systems.

## Assignments

1. Pick two systems (one mechanical, one thermal) and identify all 4 anatomy blocks.
2. For each system, list one likely disturbance and where it enters.
