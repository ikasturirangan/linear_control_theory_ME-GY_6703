# The Language of Signals

Control diagrams are arrows carrying signals.
The symbols below appear in almost every textbook and lecture.

| Symbol | Name | Easy English |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `r(t)` | Reference | Your goal (for example, 70 degrees). |
| `y(t)` | Output | The reality (for example, 68 degrees). |
| `e(t)` | Error | The gap: goal minus reality, `r(t) - y(t)`. |
| `u(t)` | Control Signal | The effort sent to the actuator. |

`(t)` means the quantity changes over time.

## How they connect

In a basic feedback loop:

- Error is computed as `e(t) = r(t) - y(t)`
- The controller uses `e(t)` to generate `u(t)`
- The plant responds and produces `y(t)`

<ClosedLoopDiagram

  controlLabel="u(t)"
  errorLabel="e(t)"
  forwardBlocks={["Controller", "Plant"]}
  sensorLabel="Sensor"
/>

Use Block Diagram 4 to map every symbol to a physical meaning.

## One concrete number example

Suppose a room temperature controller has:

- `r(t) = 22` degC (target)
- `y(t) = 20` degC (measured)

Then:

- `e(t) = 22 - 20 = 2` degC

A positive error tells the controller to increase heating effort, so `u(t)` goes up.
In Block Diagram 4, this means the signal leaving `[ Controller ]` increases.

## Sign convention note

Most beginner diagrams use negative feedback:

`e(t) = r(t) - y(t)`

If you accidentally flip it to `y(t) - r(t)`, the system may push in the wrong direction.
That sign choice is the `(+/-)` node in Block Diagram 4.

## Common mistakes

- Mixing up `u(t)` and `y(t)`:
  `u(t)` is what you command, `y(t)` is what nature gives back.
- Ignoring units:
  `e(t)` has same unit as `r(t)` and `y(t)`, but `u(t)` can be different (volts, torque, valve %).

When these four symbols are clear, block diagrams and equations become much easier to read.

## Check yourself

If target speed is `30 m/s` and measured speed is `27 m/s`, what are:

- `r(t)`
- `y(t)`
- `e(t)`
