# Typical Test Inputs

To understand a system, we "poke" it with standard inputs and observe the response.
These inputs are chosen because they reveal important behavior quickly.

## Why these three inputs?

They are simple, repeatable, and mathematically useful.
Also, many real commands can be built by combining these patterns.

In Block Diagram 6, only the input shape changes; the system block stays the same.
That makes test results comparable.

## Step Input

A sudden jump in value, like flipping a light switch.

What it reveals:

- Rise time
- Overshoot
- Settling time
- Steady-state error

Common use: first performance check for a controller.
In Block Diagram 6, set the input generator to `step(t)`.

## Ramp Input

A target that increases steadily with time.

What it reveals:

- Tracking ability
- Lag against moving references
- Velocity error behavior

Common use: tests whether the loop can follow moving targets, not just fixed ones.
In Block Diagram 6, set the input generator to `ramp(t)`.

## Impulse Input

A very short, sharp shock, like tapping a bell.

What it reveals:

- Natural modes
- Oscillation frequencies
- Damping characteristics

Common use: identifies intrinsic dynamics quickly.
In Block Diagram 6, set the input generator to `impulse(t)`.

## Fast mental picture

- Step asks: "How do you react to sudden change?"
- Ramp asks: "Can you keep up with a moving goal?"
- Impulse asks: "What are your natural vibrations?"

## Mathematical forms

- Unit step: $u(t) = 1$ for $t \ge 0$
- Unit ramp: $r(t) = t$ for $t \ge 0$
- Unit impulse: $\delta(t)$ with unit area

## Why these matter

If you can predict and interpret step, ramp, and impulse responses, you can reason about most basic control performance questions.

## Check yourself

You are tuning drone altitude hold:

1. Which input best checks disturbance rejection after a sudden command change?
2. Which input best checks tracking of a steadily climbing trajectory?
