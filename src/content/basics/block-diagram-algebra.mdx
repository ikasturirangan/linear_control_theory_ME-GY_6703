# Block Diagram Algebra

Block-diagram algebra is how you convert a control wiring picture into equations you can analyze.

## Why this matters

If you can reduce a diagram to one equivalent transfer function, you can immediately study:

- poles and zeros
- stability
- step response
- steady-state error

If drawing diagrams is still new, study [Block Diagrams Chapter](/block-diagrams) first.

## Block Diagram A: Series Connection

<OpenLoopDiagram
  caption="Block Diagram A: Series Connection"
  blocks={["G1(s)", "G2(s)"]}
  outputLabel="y"
  referenceLabel="r"
/>

Equivalent transfer function:

$$
G_{eq}(s) = G_1(s)G_2(s)
$$

Interpretation: signals pass through both blocks one after another, so effects multiply.

## Block Diagram B: Parallel Connection

<ParallelConnectionDiagram
  caption="Block Diagram B: Parallel Connection"
  inputLabel="r"
  lowerBlockLabel="G2(s)"
  outputLabel="y"
  upperBlockLabel="G1(s)"
/>

Equivalent transfer function (if summed with same sign):

$$
G_{eq}(s) = G_1(s) + G_2(s)
$$

Interpretation: both paths see the same input and outputs are added.

## Block Diagram C: Single Negative-Feedback Loop

<ClosedLoopDiagram
  caption="Block Diagram C: Single Negative-Feedback Loop"
  errorLabel=""
  forwardBlocks={["G(s)"]}
  outputLabel="y"
  referenceLabel="r"
  sensorLabel="H(s)"
/>

Equivalent closed-loop transfer function:

$$
T(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{G(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)}
$$

For positive feedback, denominator changes to $1 - G(s)H(s)$.

## One quick reduction example

Suppose:

- $G_1(s)=\frac{5}{s+1}$
- $G_2(s)=\frac{2}{s+4}$
- Unity feedback, so $H(s)=1$

1. Combine series forward path:
   $$
   G(s)=G_1G_2=\frac{10}{(s+1)(s+4)}
   $$
2. Apply feedback formula:
   $$
   T(s)=\frac{G}{1+G}=\frac{10}{(s+1)(s+4)+10}
   $$

Now the whole system is one transfer function ready for analysis.

## Beginner checklist

When reducing diagrams:

1. Identify series chunks first.
2. Identify parallel chunks next.
3. Apply feedback formula last.
4. Re-check feedback sign at the summing node.

## Next step
