# Linear vs. Non-Linear

This course is called linear control systems for a reason.
Linear models are predictable and give us tools that are fast and powerful.

## Why This Matters

Linearity is the assumption that unlocks transfer functions, superposition, and most tools in this course.

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic signal and loop notation
- Idea of local operating point

## Learning Outcomes

1. State scaling and additivity conditions for linearity.
2. Explain why real systems are modeled as locally linear.
3. Identify when linear approximation may fail.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Linearity | Scaling + additivity property |
| Superposition | Response to sum equals sum of responses |
| Linearization | Local linear approximation near operating point |
| Saturation | Actuator or state limit causing nonlinearity |

## What "linear" means

For a system operator $G[\cdot]$, linearity means two rules:

1. Scaling:
   <EquationHelp hint="Scaling means proportional response: multiply input by alpha, output should multiply by the same alpha.">

   $$
   G[\alpha u(t)] = \alpha G[u(t)]
   $$

   </EquationHelp>
2. Additivity:
   <EquationHelp hint="Additivity means responses superpose: response to sum of inputs equals sum of individual responses.">

   $$
   G[u_1(t) + u_2(t)] = G[u_1(t)] + G[u_2(t)]
   $$

   </EquationHelp>

Together, this is called superposition.
It is why we can use transfer functions, poles/zeros, and frequency response cleanly.

## Reality check

Real systems are rarely perfectly linear.

Common non-linear effects:

- Saturation (actuator limits)
- Friction and dead zones
- Backlash and hysteresis

Block Diagram 5 is the core idea behind linearization: model the local behavior, not the entire nonlinear world.

## Simple intuition example

- Ideal spring: force is proportional to displacement -> approximately linear in a range.
- Real actuator: command may hit a max limit -> saturation -> non-linear behavior.

## The practical trick: linearization

Engineers often pick an operating point and approximate the system locally as linear.
That approximation is usually good enough in a small range around that point.
Block Diagram 5 shows this "global nonlinear, local linear" strategy.

Mathematically, this comes from first-order Taylor expansion near an equilibrium.
You keep the first-order terms and ignore higher-order terms.

## Why this is useful

This is why linear control works so well in practice:

- solve a simpler local model fast
- design a controller with strong tools
- validate and retune on the real non-linear system

## Key warning

Linear models are local approximations, not universal truth.
If the state moves far from the operating point, predictions can degrade quickly.

## Check yourself

For a motor with voltage command limited to +/-12 V:

1. Is behavior linear near small commands?
2. What happens to linearity near saturation?

## Detailed Review

1. Why does linearization depend on operating region?
2. Why do high-amplitude commands often violate linear assumptions?
3. How can you test linear-model validity experimentally?

## Assignments

1. Identify one nonlinearity in each of: motor, thermal, and fluid systems.
2. Describe a likely operating region where linear approximation is acceptable.
