# How to Study This Course

## Why This Matters

Control is not memorization-heavy by itself; it is connection-heavy. You need a repeatable study loop.

## Recommended study cycle

For each module, use:

1. **Read**: understand the main idea and symbols.
2. **Derive**: rework one equation without notes.
3. **Practice**: solve 3-6 short problems.
4. **Self-explain**: explain concept out loud in plain English.
5. **Review**: revisit mistakes after 24-48 hours.

## Time split per 2-hour session

- 25 min concept reading
- 35 min derivation + worked examples
- 45 min problem solving
- 15 min mistake review and summary notes

## How to take notes effectively

Keep three short blocks per topic:

- **Formula**: final expression
- **Meaning**: what each term means physically
- **Failure mode**: when the formula/assumption breaks

## Mistake log format

For every error, record:

- problem ID,
- exact mistake,
- correct method,
- trigger sentence ("next time check sign at summing node").

## Before exams

Use this order:

1. mixed problems,
2. weak-topic review,
3. 60-second oral explanations,
4. formula sheet compression.
