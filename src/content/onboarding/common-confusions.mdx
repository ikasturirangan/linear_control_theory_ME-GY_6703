# Common Confusions

## Why This Matters

Most performance loss in learning comes from repeated conceptual mix-ups.

## Routh vs Nyquist

**Confusion:** both are unrelated methods.

**Correction:** both answer the same closed-loop stability question.

- Routh: coefficient-table algebra from characteristic polynomial.
- Nyquist: frequency-domain geometry via encirclements of `-1+j0`.

## Transfer Function vs State-Space

**Confusion:** state-space replaces transfer functions completely.

**Correction:** both are equivalent linear representations (under conditions).

- TF is compact for SISO frequency/time response analysis.
- State-space is stronger for MIMO, observers, controllability, modern control.

## Continuous vs Discrete Stability

**Confusion:** same geometric rule applies.

**Correction:** stability regions differ.

- Continuous: poles in left half-plane.
- Discrete: poles inside unit circle.

## Open-loop stability vs Closed-loop stability

**Confusion:** stable plant means stable controlled system automatically.

**Correction:** controller can destabilize a stable plant (and can stabilize unstable plants).

## High gain means always better tracking

**Confusion:** larger gain is always good.

**Correction:** higher gain can reduce margins, amplify noise, and increase oscillation risk.

## Phase margin gives exact overshoot

**Confusion:** one fixed PM means one exact overshoot.

**Correction:** PM-overshoot relationship is approximate and model-dependent.
