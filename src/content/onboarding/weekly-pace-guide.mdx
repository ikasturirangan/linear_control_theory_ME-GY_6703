# Weekly Study Time and Pace Guide

## Why This Matters

Most students fall behind from pacing errors, not intelligence gaps.

## Recommended weekly time

- **Minimum pass-focused pace**: 5-6 hours/week
- **Strong conceptual pace**: 7-9 hours/week
- **Mastery pace**: 10-12 hours/week

## Weekly structure

1. **Session A (2-3h)**: learn new concept pages.
2. **Session B (2-3h)**: worked examples + derivation practice.
3. **Session C (1-3h)**: practice problems + error correction.

## Week-by-week emphasis

| Weeks | Main focus | Suggested extra time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 | Modeling, TF, SSE basics | +1h if Laplace feels weak |
| 3-5 | Bode, Nyquist, stability criteria | +1h for plot interpretation drills |
| 6-8 | Digital/sampled-data foundations | +1h for $z$-domain fluency |
| 9-13 | State-space and modern control | +1-2h for matrix and derivation work |

## Recovery plan if behind

If you miss a week:

1. Do one concept summary pass first.
2. Solve only high-yield problems next.
3. Return to full derivations after catching up.

## Burnout avoidance

- Keep one weekly off-day.
- Use 45-10 study blocks (45 min work, 10 min break).
- End each session with a 3-line summary.
