# Laplace Transform Basics

## Why This Matters

Transfer functions are built using Laplace transforms. Without this bridge, module 3.1 feels mechanical.

## What You Should Already Know

- Derivatives
- Basic integration concept

## Learning Outcomes

1. Explain why Laplace is used in control.
2. Apply core transform pairs used in first modules.
3. Use zero-initial-condition assumption in transfer-function derivation.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Laplace transform | Map from time domain to complex-frequency domain |
| $s$ | Complex variable used in Laplace analysis |
| Initial condition | State/value at $t=0$ |
| Transfer function | $G(s)=Y(s)/U(s)$ with zero initial conditions |

## Explanation

Laplace transform turns derivatives into multiplication by $s$:

- time-domain differential equation -> algebraic equation in $s$
- easier to solve and analyze poles/zeros

Key identity used in control:

$$
\mathcal{L}\{\dot{y}(t)\}=sY(s)-y(0)
$$

With zero initial conditions, this simplifies to $sY(s)$.

## Worked Example

Given:

$$
\tau\dot{y}(t)+y(t)=Ku(t)
$$

Laplace with zero initial conditions:

$$
(\tau s+1)Y(s)=KU(s)
$$

So:

$$
G(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}=\frac{K}{\tau s+1}
$$

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting initial-condition terms during transform.
- Calling $Y(s)$ itself a transfer function.
- Mixing time-domain and $s$-domain variables in one equation line.

## Detailed Review

1. Why does Laplace make modeling easier?
2. What exact assumption is required for TF definition?
3. What does denominator degree represent physically?

## Assignments

1. Derive TF from $\ddot{y}+3\dot{y}+2y=u$ under zero initial conditions.
2. Explain in one paragraph why transfer functions are not defined from nonzero initial-condition response directly.
