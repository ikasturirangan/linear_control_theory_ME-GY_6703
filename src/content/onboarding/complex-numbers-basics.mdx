# Complex Numbers Basics

## Why This Matters

Poles, oscillation, damping, and frequency response all rely on complex numbers.

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic algebra
- Square roots and powers

## Learning Outcomes

1. Interpret $a + jb$ as point and as oscillation component.
2. Convert between rectangular and magnitude-angle forms.
3. Explain what real and imaginary parts mean for pole behavior.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| $j$ | Imaginary unit, $j^2=-1$ |
| Complex number | $z=a+jb$ |
| Magnitude | $|z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ |
| Angle | $\theta=\tan^{-1}(b/a)$ |
| Conjugate | $a-jb$ |

## Explanation

Rectangular form: $z = a + jb$

Polar form: $z = |z|e^{j\theta}$

For control poles:

- Real part ($a$) controls growth/decay.
- Imaginary part ($b$) controls oscillation frequency.

## Worked Example

Given $z=-2+j3$:

- Magnitude: $|z|=\sqrt{13}$
- Angle: $\theta=\tan^{-1}(3/-2)$ (quadrant II)

Interpretation for pole: decaying oscillation because real part is negative and imaginary part nonzero.

## Common Mistakes

- Ignoring quadrant when computing angle.
- Forgetting complex poles in real systems appear as conjugate pairs.
- Treating imaginary part as instability by itself (real part determines stability sign).

## Detailed Review

1. Why does negative real part imply decay?
2. Why do conjugate poles imply sinusoidal components?
3. How does bigger $|\operatorname{Im}(p)|$ change oscillation frequency?

## Assignments

1. Convert $-1+j2$ and $-1-j2$ to magnitude-angle form.
2. For poles $-0.5\pm j4$, state damping tendency and oscillation tendency.
