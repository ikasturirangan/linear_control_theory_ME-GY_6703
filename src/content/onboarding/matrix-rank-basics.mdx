# Matrix and Rank Basics

## Why This Matters

Modern control (state-space, observers, pole placement, LQR) depends on matrix operations.

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic arithmetic
- Simple equation solving

## Learning Outcomes

1. Multiply matrices with dimension checks.
2. Interpret rank as independent information directions.
3. Explain why rank tests appear in controllability/observability.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Matrix | Rectangular array of numbers |
| Dimension | Rows x columns |
| Rank | Number of linearly independent rows/columns |
| Invertible | Square matrix with full rank |

## Explanation

State-space uses:

$$
\dot{x}=Ax+Bu, \quad y=Cx+Du
$$

Rank appears in tests:

$$
\mathcal{C}=[B\ AB\ \cdots A^{n-1}B], \quad \mathcal{O}=\begin{bmatrix}C\\CA\\\vdots\\CA^{n-1}\end{bmatrix}
$$

Full rank means all state directions are reachable/observable.

## Worked Example

Given:

$$
\mathcal{C}=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\1&-3\end{bmatrix}
$$

Determinant is $-1 \ne 0$, so rank is 2 (full rank for 2-state system).

## Common Mistakes

- Multiplying matrices with incompatible dimensions.
- Assuming nonzero entries automatically imply full rank.
- Confusing square matrix with invertible matrix.

## Detailed Review

1. Why is rank a structural property, not a random calculation step?
2. Why do controllability/observability require rank $n$?
3. What does rank deficiency mean physically?

## Assignments

1. Compute rank for two 2x2 examples (one full rank, one deficient).
2. Build $\mathcal{C}$ for a 2-state system and test controllability.
