# Beginner Onboarding

If you are new to engineering, start here before full syllabus modules.

## Why this section exists

This bridge reduces cognitive overload by teaching only the minimum math and signal concepts needed for control.

## Recommended order

1. [No Engineering Background Starter](/onboarding/no-engineering-background)
2. [Complex Numbers Basics](/onboarding/complex-numbers-basics)
3. [Laplace Transform Basics](/onboarding/laplace-basics)
4. [Differential Equations Basics](/onboarding/differential-equations-basics)
5. [Matrix and Rank Basics](/onboarding/matrix-rank-basics)
6. [How to Study This Course](/onboarding/how-to-study)
7. [Weekly Study Time and Pace Guide](/onboarding/weekly-pace-guide)
8. [Concept Dependency Map](/onboarding/concept-dependency-map)
9. [Common Confusions](/onboarding/common-confusions)

## Then continue

- [Absolute Basics](/basics/anatomy)
- [Block Diagrams Chapter](/block-diagrams)
- [Transfer Functions for Absolute Beginners](/fundamentals/transfer-functions-beginner)
