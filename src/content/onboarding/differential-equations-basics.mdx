# Differential Equations Basics

## Why This Matters

Control models begin as differential equations from physics.

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic algebra
- Meaning of slope/rate of change

## Learning Outcomes

1. Distinguish first-order and second-order system equations.
2. Relate derivatives to physical rates (velocity, acceleration, temperature change).
3. Read ODE terms as storage, damping, and forcing effects.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ODE | Equation relating a variable and its derivatives |
| Order | Highest derivative in the equation |
| Natural response | Behavior with no external input |
| Forced response | Behavior caused by external input |

## Explanation

Typical first-order model:

$$
\tau\dot{y}+y=Ku
$$

Typical second-order model:

$$
\ddot{y}+2\zeta\omega_n\dot{y}+\omega_n^2y=\omega_n^2u
$$

Interpretation:

- derivative terms represent dynamic memory,
- coefficients represent physical properties,
- right-hand side drives system behavior.

## Worked Example

Mass-spring-damper:

$$
m\ddot{x}+c\dot{x}+kx=f(t)
$$

- $m\ddot{x}$: inertia effect
- $c\dot{x}$: damping/friction effect
- $kx$: restoring force
- $f(t)$: applied input force

## Common Mistakes

- Ignoring units when writing terms.
- Treating coefficient values as dimensionless.
- Forgetting that higher order means more internal memory/states.

## Detailed Review

1. What does equation order tell you?
2. Why do damping terms reduce oscillation?
3. How does external forcing enter model equations?

## Assignments

1. Identify order of these equations and explain physical meaning.
2. For a thermal system, propose a first-order ODE with clear variable definitions.
