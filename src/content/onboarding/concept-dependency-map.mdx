# Concept Dependency Map

## Why This Matters

This map prevents studying advanced modules before core foundations are stable.

## Dependency flow (high-level)

1. Signals and block diagrams
2. Differential equations and Laplace basics
3. Transfer functions and poles/zeros
4. Time-domain response + stability basics
5. Frequency-domain tools (Bode/Nyquist)
6. Digital and sampled-data tools
7. State-space foundations
8. Controllability/observability and design
9. LQR/MPC and capstone lab

## Module-level dependency table

| Module | Direct prerequisites |
| --- | --- |
| 3.1 Modeling, ODE, TF | Basics + Laplace basics |
| 3.2 SSE and closed-loop performance | 3.1 |
| 3.3 Bode and relative stability | 3.1 + 3.2 + complex numbers |
| 3.4 Frequency-domain design | 3.3 |
| 3.5 Routh and Nyquist | 3.2 + 3.3 |
| 3.6 Digital difference equations | 3.1 + sampling basics |
| 3.7 Jury and Z-transform | 3.6 |
| 3.8 Sampling, ZOH, A/D, D/A | 3.6 |
| 3.9 State-space and transition matrix | matrix/rank basics + 3.1 |
| 3.10 Continuous-to-discrete | 3.8 + 3.9 |
| 3.11 Controllability/observability/Ackermann | 3.9 |
| 3.12 Pole placement and observer | 3.11 |
| 3.13 LQR and MPC | 3.9 + 3.11 + optimization intuition |

## Use this map in practice

Before starting a new module, ask:

- Can I explain its prerequisite topics in one minute?
- Can I solve one prerequisite problem without notes?

If not, review prerequisites first.
