# No Engineering Background Starter

## Why This Matters

Control can feel abstract at first. This page gives you the minimum mental model so the later math has context.

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic algebra and graph reading
- Comfort with high-school equations

## Learning Outcomes

By the end, you should be able to:

1. Describe a control loop in plain English.
2. Identify goal, reality, and corrective action.
3. Explain why feedback is essential.

## Glossary

| Term | Simple meaning |
| --- | --- |
| System | The thing you want to influence (room, motor, drone) |
| Input | What you command |
| Output | What actually happens |
| Feedback | Measuring output and using it to adjust input |
| Error | Difference between target and reality |

## Explanation

Think of control as a repeated cycle:

1. Set a goal.
2. Measure current reality.
3. Compute difference.
4. Apply correction.
5. Repeat.

That cycle is the foundation of all topics in this course.

## Worked Example

Home thermostat:

- Goal: 22 degC
- Measured: 20 degC
- Error: +2 degC
- Action: increase heating

This is exactly what control theory formalizes mathematically.

## Common Mistakes

- Thinking control is only about equations (it starts with physical reasoning).
- Confusing command signal with measured output.
- Ignoring disturbances (wind, load changes, heat loss).

## Detailed Review

Check that you can answer:

1. Why open-loop systems fail under disturbances.
2. Why feedback reduces uncertainty.
3. What error signal represents physically.

## Assignments

1. Pick one real object (fan speed, water level, cruise control) and identify input/output/error.
2. Describe one disturbance for that object and how feedback would correct it.
