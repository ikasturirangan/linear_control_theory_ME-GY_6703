# Stability Worked Example

## Problem

Unity-feedback system with open-loop plant:

$$
G(s)=\frac{K}{s(s+2)}
$$

Tasks:

1. Find characteristic equation.
2. Find gain range for asymptotic stability.
3. Describe overshoot trend as $K$ increases in stable range.

## Solution

### Step 1: Characteristic equation

Closed-loop denominator for unity feedback:

$$
1+G(s)=0 \Rightarrow 1+\frac{K}{s(s+2)}=0
$$

Multiply through:

$$
s(s+2)+K=0 \Rightarrow s^2+2s+K=0
$$

### Step 2: Stability range

For second-order polynomial $s^2+a_1s+a_0$, stability requires $a_1>0$ and $a_0>0$.

Here:

- $a_1=2>0$
- $a_0=K$

So stable if:

$$
K>0
$$

### Step 3: Overshoot trend

Match with standard form:

$$
s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s+\omega_n^2
$$

Hence:

- $\omega_n^2=K \Rightarrow \omega_n=\sqrt{K}$
- $2\zeta\omega_n=2 \Rightarrow \zeta=\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}$

As $K$ increases, $\zeta$ decreases.
Lower damping ratio means larger oscillation/overshoot.

## Final answer

- Stable gain range: $K>0$
- Increasing $K$ tends to increase overshoot (while response becomes faster in natural-frequency sense).
