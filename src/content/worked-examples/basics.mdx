# Basics Worked Example

## Problem

A room-heating system has:

- Desired temperature set by user.
- Temperature sensor in room.
- Controller that computes heater command from temperature error.
- Electric heater that injects heat.

Tasks:

1. Identify plant, sensor, controller, actuator.
2. State whether it is open-loop or closed-loop.
3. If target is 22 degC and measured temperature is 19.5 degC, compute error.

## Solution

### Step 1: Identify blocks

- Plant: room thermal dynamics.
- Sensor: room temperature sensor.
- Controller: thermostat logic/software.
- Actuator: electric heater power stage.

### Step 2: Classify loop type

Measured output (temperature) is fed back into decision logic.
Therefore this is **closed-loop control**.

### Step 3: Compute error

Using negative feedback sign convention:

$$
e(t)=r(t)-y(t)
$$

Given $r=22$, $y=19.5$:

$$
e=22-19.5=2.5\text{ degC}
$$

A positive error means controller should increase heating effort.

## Takeaway

In basics problems, full marks come from clean identification of loop anatomy and correct sign convention.
