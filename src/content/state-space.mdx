# State-Space Methods

State-space form gives a compact way to represent multi-variable systems:

## Why This Matters

State-space is the bridge from classical control to modern control design (observer, pole placement, LQR, MPC).

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic matrix multiplication
- Transfer-function fundamentals

## Learning Outcomes

1. Read and interpret standard state-space equations.
2. Explain controllability and observability rank tests.
3. Connect state-space structure to design feasibility.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| State vector $x$ | Minimal internal memory variables |
| $A,B,C,D$ matrices | Dynamics/input/output/feedthrough matrices |
| Controllability | Ability to move all state directions by input |
| Observability | Ability to reconstruct states from outputs |

<EquationHelp hint="State equation shows how internal states evolve. Output equation maps those states (and possibly input) to measured outputs.">

$$
\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t), \quad y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t)
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Why this form matters

- Works naturally for MIMO systems
- Connects directly to modern control design
- Makes structural properties testable with matrix rank

## Structural checks

For continuous-time LTI systems:

- Controllability matrix:
  <EquationHelp hint="This matrix stacks how input direction B propagates through dynamics A. Full rank means every state direction can be reached by suitable input.">

  $$
  \mathcal{C} = \begin{bmatrix} B & AB & A^2B & \cdots & A^{n-1}B \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  </EquationHelp>
- Observability matrix:
  <EquationHelp hint="This matrix stacks how state directions appear in output through repeated A-action. Full rank means states can be reconstructed from output history.">

  $$
  \mathcal{O} = \begin{bmatrix} C \\ CA \\ CA^2 \\ \vdots \\ CA^{n-1} \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  </EquationHelp>

If $\mathrm{rank}(\mathcal{C}) = n$, the pair $(A,B)$ is controllable.
If $\mathrm{rank}(\mathcal{O}) = n$, the pair $(C,A)$ is observable.

Without notes, explain what rank deficiency in controllability means physically for control authority.

## Practice prompt

Pick a 2-state model and compute $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{O}$ by hand.
Then explain which states are physically hard to actuate or measure.

## Detailed Review

1. Why do states represent memory of the system?
2. Why is rank condition structural and not optional?
3. What does uncontrollable mode imply for controller design?

## Assignments

1. Build a 2-state model from a second-order ODE and identify $A,B,C,D$.
2. Compute controllability and observability ranks for one 2x2 example.
