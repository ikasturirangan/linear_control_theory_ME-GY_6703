# Step Response and Pole Sliders

This page gives two linked intuition tools:

- Time-domain behavior from second-order parameters.
- Pole movement in the complex plane as loop gain changes.

## Demo 1: Second-Order Step Response

<StepResponseDemo />

Interpretation focus:

- Lower $\zeta$ usually increases overshoot.
- Larger $\omega_n$ usually speeds up response.
- Settling-time and overshoot trade off through parameter choice.

## Demo 2: Pole Movement with Gain

<PoleMovementDemo />

Interpretation focus:

- Pole location drives response shape.
- Complex-conjugate poles imply oscillatory modes.
- Negative real part means decay; positive real part would imply divergence.
