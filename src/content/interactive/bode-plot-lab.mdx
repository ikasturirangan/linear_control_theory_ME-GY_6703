# Bode Plot Lab

This lab helps you connect Bode-shape changes to control decisions.

## Interactive demo

<BodePlotDemo />

## What to test

1. Increase gain and note how crossover frequency changes.
2. Move the first corner frequency lower and observe earlier roll-off.
3. Move both corners close together and inspect phase lag accumulation.

## What to conclude

- Higher crossover can improve speed but reduce margin.
- More phase lag near crossover usually reduces damping/robustness.
- Frequency-domain tuning is a tradeoff, not a single-number optimization.
