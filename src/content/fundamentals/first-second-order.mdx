# First vs Second Order Behavior

Most beginner control questions reduce to recognizing whether dynamics are first-order-like or second-order-like.

## First-order template

<EquationHelp hint="First-order systems have one pole and one dominant time scale. Tau controls how quickly the response moves toward its final value.">

$$
G(s)=\frac{K}{\tau s+1}
$$

</EquationHelp>

- $K$: static gain
- $\tau$: time constant

For a unit-step input, the output reaches about:

- 63% at $t=\tau$
- 95% at $t\approx3\tau$
- 98% at $t\approx4\tau$

Mental picture: smooth rise, no oscillation.

## Second-order template

<EquationHelp hint="Second-order form separates speed and damping: wn sets natural speed, zeta sets how oscillatory or smooth the response is.">

$$
G(s)=\frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\zeta\omega_n s + \omega_n^2}
$$

</EquationHelp>

- $\zeta$: damping ratio
- $\omega_n$: natural frequency

Approximate performance relations (underdamped region $0<\zeta<1$):

Peak overshoot formula:

<EquationHelp hint="Overshoot drops as zeta increases. A lightly damped system (small zeta) overshoots more.">

$$
M_p\approx e^{-\pi\zeta/\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}\times100\%
$$

</EquationHelp>

2% settling time estimate:

<EquationHelp hint="Settling time gets shorter if either damping (zeta) or natural frequency (wn) increases, because the decay envelope shrinks faster.">

$$
T_s\approx\frac{4}{\zeta\omega_n}
$$

</EquationHelp>

Peak time:

<EquationHelp hint="Peak time mainly depends on damped oscillation frequency. Larger wn usually means earlier peak.">

$$
T_p=\frac{\pi}{\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}
$$

</EquationHelp>

Mental picture: can oscillate and overshoot depending on $\zeta$.

## Quick compare table

| Feature | First Order | Second Order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oscillation possible? | No | Yes (if $\zeta<1$) |
| Main speed parameter | $\tau$ | $\omega_n$ |
| Damping parameter | Not separate | $\zeta$ |
| Typical test question | Time constant | Overshoot/settling tradeoff |

## Use the interactive plot

Try [Step and Pole Sliders](/interactive/step-and-poles) and vary $\zeta$ and $\omega_n$.
Watch how rise speed and overshoot change.
Then connect time-domain behavior to frequency-domain robustness in [Frequency Response and Bode Plots](/fundamentals/frequency-response-bode).

## Check yourself

Given a system with $\zeta=0.2$ and $\omega_n=3$ rad/s:

1. Will the step response overshoot noticeably?
2. If you increase $\zeta$ while keeping $\omega_n$ fixed, what happens to overshoot?
