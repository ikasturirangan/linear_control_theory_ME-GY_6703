# Frequency Response and Bode Plots

Bode plots answer a core control question:
how does the system react to different input frequencies?

## Why this belongs in the core syllabus

- Time-domain specs tell you speed and overshoot.
- Bode plots tell you robustness and noise sensitivity.
- Together, they give a complete tuning picture.

## Bode plot structure

A Bode plot has two graphs versus frequency (log scale):

1. Magnitude in dB
2. Phase in degrees

For a transfer function $G(j\omega)$:

<EquationHelp hint="Magnitude says how much sinusoidal inputs are amplified or attenuated at each frequency. 0 dB means output amplitude equals input amplitude.">

$$
\text{Magnitude (dB)} = 20\log_{10}|G(j\omega)|
$$

</EquationHelp>

<EquationHelp hint="Phase says how much the sinusoidal output lags the input. More negative phase often means less stability margin.">

$$
\text{Phase (deg)} = \angle G(j\omega)
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Key margin concepts

- Gain crossover frequency $\omega_{gc}$: where magnitude crosses 0 dB.
- Phase margin (PM): how far phase is from $-180^\circ$ at $\omega_{gc}$.
- Larger PM usually means less oscillatory closed-loop behavior.

<EquationHelp hint="A quick rule: PM around 45 to 60 degrees is often a practical target for many loops, though exact targets depend on requirements.">

$$
\mathrm{PM} = 180^\circ + \angle G(j\omega_{gc})
$$

</EquationHelp>

Use the sliders and observe:

- Increasing gain shifts magnitude upward.
- Lower corner frequencies start roll-off earlier.
- Phase lag accumulates as frequency passes each pole.

## Practical interpretation checklist

1. Find $\omega_{gc}$.
2. Read phase at $\omega_{gc}$.
3. Compute/estimate phase margin.
4. Ask whether disturbance rejection and robustness tradeoff is acceptable.
