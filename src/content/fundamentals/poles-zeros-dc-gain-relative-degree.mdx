# Poles, Zeros, DC Gain, and Relative Degree (Beginner Guide)

When students first see transfer functions, these four words show up everywhere.
This page explains them in plain language first, then math.

## Why This Matters

Most quick engineering judgments about speed, robustness trend, and transient shape start from these four features.

## What You Should Already Know

- Transfer function definition
- Numerator and denominator basics

## Learning Outcomes

1. Extract poles, zeros, DC gain, and relative degree from any simple TF.
2. Predict qualitative behavior from these values.
3. Connect TF features to time-domain and frequency-domain intuition.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Pole | Denominator root of $G(s)$ |
| Zero | Numerator root of $G(s)$ |
| DC gain | Low-frequency gain $G(0)$ |
| Relative degree | Denominator order minus numerator order |
| Roll-off | High-frequency attenuation trend |

## Why these four matter

For

$$
G(s)=\frac{N(s)}{D(s)}
$$

you can often predict most behavior from:

1. poles
2. zeros
3. DC gain
4. relative degree

Think of them as a quick \"system fingerprint.\"

## 1) Poles: where natural behavior comes from

Poles are the roots of the denominator $D(s)=0$.

<EquationHelp hint="Poles are values of s that make the denominator zero. They are tied to natural modes and stability tendency.">

$$
\text{Poles: } D(s)=0
$$

</EquationHelp>

### Intuition

- Poles tell you how the system behaves on its own.
- In continuous time, poles with negative real part usually decay.
- Poles with positive real part usually grow (unstable).
- Poles near imaginary axis decay slowly and can cause long settling.

### Tiny example

$$
G(s)=\frac{5}{(s+1)(s+4)}
$$

Poles are at $s=-1,-4$.
Both are negative, so open-loop natural behavior is decaying.

## 2) Zeros: where response shape is modified

Zeros are the roots of numerator $N(s)=0$.

<EquationHelp hint="Zeros are values of s that make the numerator zero. They shape how input appears at output, especially transient shape.">

$$
\text{Zeros: } N(s)=0
$$

</EquationHelp>

### Intuition

- Zeros do not usually decide stability directly like poles do.
- Zeros strongly affect transient shape (overshoot, undershoot, initial direction).
- Right-half-plane zeros can create inverse response (initial movement in wrong direction).

### Tiny example

$$
G(s)=\frac{s+2}{(s+1)(s+4)}
$$

Zero is at $s=-2$.
Compared to no-zero case, step-response shape changes even if poles stay same.

## 3) DC gain: low-frequency/static scaling

DC gain means gain at zero frequency (constant input).

<EquationHelp hint="DC gain is G(0) when it exists. It gives long-term output/input scaling for constant or very slow inputs.">

$$
K_{DC}=G(0)
$$

</EquationHelp>

### Intuition

- If $K_{DC}=2$, a constant input of 1 tends to output around 2 (in compatible units).
- DC gain helps estimate steady-state scaling.
- If $G(0)$ is infinite (integrator present), do not interpret it as ordinary static scaling.

### Tiny example

$$
G(s)=\frac{10}{s+2}
$$

$$
K_{DC}=G(0)=\frac{10}{2}=5
$$

So very slow/constant input is amplified by about 5.

## 4) Relative degree: numerator order vs denominator order

Relative degree is:

<EquationHelp hint="Relative degree is denominator order minus numerator order. It predicts high-frequency roll-off and realizability hints.">

$$
r=\deg(D)-\deg(N)
$$

</EquationHelp>

### Intuition

- Larger relative degree -> stronger high-frequency attenuation.
- In Bode magnitude, each extra degree gives about additional -20 dB/dec high-frequency slope.
- Proper/strictly proper transfer functions are usually physically realizable models.

### Quick classification

- Proper: $\deg(D)\ge\deg(N)$
- Strictly proper: $\deg(D)>\deg(N)$
- Improper: $\deg(D)<\deg(N)$ (often not physically realizable without extra dynamics)

## One combined reading example

Given:

$$
G(s)=\frac{2(s+3)}{(s+1)(s+5)}
$$

- Poles: $-1,-5$
- Zero: $-3$
- DC gain: $G(0)=\frac{2\cdot3}{1\cdot5}=1.2$
- Relative degree: $2-1=1$

What this suggests quickly:

- stable tendency (all poles in LHP),
- one zero shaping transient,
- low-frequency scaling around 1.2,
- moderate high-frequency roll-off.

## Common beginner mistakes

- Mixing pole and zero definitions (denominator vs numerator).
- Thinking zeros alone decide stability.
- Using DC gain without checking if $G(0)$ exists.
- Forgetting relative degree sign and subtracting in wrong order.

4. [Stability and Performance](/stability)

## Detailed Review

1. Which of these four most strongly influences stability tendency?
2. Why can zeros change transient shape without deciding stability alone?
3. How does relative degree affect high-frequency behavior?

## Assignments

1. For three transfer functions, extract all four features and compare expected behavior.
2. Explain how shifting one pole closer to the imaginary axis changes settling tendency.
