# Modeling and Transfer Functions

This chapter turns physical intuition into math you can compute with.

If you are completely new, read [Transfer Functions for Absolute Beginners](/fundamentals/transfer-functions-beginner) first.
If block-diagram flow is unclear, first review [Block Diagrams Chapter](/block-diagrams).

## Why This Matters

This chapter is the mathematical entry point for nearly all classical control analysis and design.

## What You Should Already Know

- Basic loop anatomy and signal labels
- Intro differential-equation notation

## Learning Outcomes

1. Derive transfer functions from physical models.
2. Interpret poles/zeros from model structure.
3. Use transfer functions for response and stability reasoning.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ODE | Time-domain differential equation model |
| Laplace transform | Algebraic transform for linear dynamics |
| TF | Transfer function $G(s)=Y/U$ |
| Pole/zero | Denominator/numerator roots affecting behavior |

## Core workflow

1. Write a differential equation from physics.
2. Choose input $u(t)$ and output $y(t)$ clearly.
3. Apply Laplace transform under zero initial conditions.
4. Form the transfer function $G(s)=Y(s)/U(s)$.

## Canonical model form

For a linear time-invariant differential equation:

<EquationHelp hint="This equation says output derivatives are weighted and summed, then related to weighted input derivatives. It is the most general LTI differential-equation template.">

$$
a_n y^{(n)}(t) + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)}(t) + \cdots + a_0 y(t)
=
b_m u^{(m)}(t) + \cdots + b_0 u(t)
$$

</EquationHelp>

Laplace transform gives:

<EquationHelp hint="This is the transfer function definition in practice: output over input in the Laplace domain with zero initial conditions. Numerator sets zeros; denominator sets poles.">

$$
G(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}=\frac{b_m s^m + \cdots + b_0}{a_n s^n + \cdots + a_0}
$$

</EquationHelp>

## What to read from $G(s)$ quickly

- Poles: natural modes, stability tendency, dominant speed.
- Zeros: shape transient behavior and can create undershoot/overshoot changes.
- DC gain: low-frequency scaling between input and output.
- Relative degree: hints about high-frequency roll-off and physical realizability.

If these four terms are new, read [Poles, Zeros, DC Gain, Relative Degree (Beginner Guide)](/fundamentals/poles-zeros-dc-gain-relative-degree) before continuing.

## Common modeling traps

- Mixing force and acceleration units.
- Forgetting zero initial condition assumption when defining transfer function.
- Choosing output that is not what the sensor actually measures.

## Detailed Review

1. Why does model selection determine controller outcomes?
2. Why is zero-initial-condition assumption central to TF definition?
3. How do poles and zeros encode behavior differently?

## Assignments

1. Build one model from physics and derive its TF end-to-end.
2. Compare two parameter sets and predict response-speed differences.
