# Step Response vs Bode vs Nyquist (Detailed Comparison)

Students often ask: are Step, Bode, and Nyquist three different topics, or the same topic in three forms?

They are **the same feedback system seen through three lenses**:

- Step response: time-domain behavior you can directly feel.
- Bode: frequency-domain shaping and robustness margins.
- Nyquist: geometric stability/robustness check around the critical point.

If you learn the connections, tuning decisions become much faster and less confusing.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this page, you should be able to:

1. Explain what question each lens answers best.
2. Relate overshoot/settling trends to margin and crossover trends.
3. Use Step + Bode + Nyquist in one practical tuning workflow.
4. Avoid common interpretation mistakes when switching domains.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Step response | Output $y(t)$ when input is a step change. |
| Rise time | How quickly output reaches near final value. |
| Overshoot | Peak amount above final value after a step. |
| Settling time | Time until response stays in a small error band. |
| Loop transfer | Open-loop product $L(s)=C(s)G(s)H(s)$. |
| Crossover frequency | Frequency where Bode magnitude crosses 0 dB. |
| Phase margin (PM) | Phase distance from $-180^\circ$ at crossover. |
| Nyquist encirclement | Net loops around $-1+j0$ used for stability test. |
| Relative stability | How robustly stable the loop is, not just stable/unstable. |

## Explanation

A practical control engineer rarely uses only one of these.
Instead:

1. Set performance goals in time domain (step specs).
2. Shape loop in frequency domain (Bode).
3. Confirm no hidden stability risk (Nyquist).

This three-view workflow is one of the most important habits in classical control.

## One shared setup

Let the loop transfer be:

<EquationHelp hint="Loop transfer combines controller, plant, and sensor path. Bode and Nyquist are both drawn from this same L(jw).">

$$
L(s)=C(s)G(s)H(s)
$$

</EquationHelp>

Closed-loop transfer (reference to output):

<EquationHelp hint="Step response comes from this closed-loop transfer function. Poles of T(s) shape rise, overshoot, and settling.">

$$
T(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\frac{L(s)}{1+L(s)}
$$

</EquationHelp>

Sensitivity (disturbance/noise robustness insight):

<EquationHelp hint="When 1+L is small near some frequency, sensitivity grows and robustness drops. This is why Nyquist distance to -1 matters.">

$$
S(s)=\frac{1}{1+L(s)}
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Lens 1: Step Response (time domain)

Best for answering:

- Is response fast enough?
- Is overshoot acceptable?
- Does it settle cleanly?

Typical metrics:

- Rise time $t_r$
- Percent overshoot $M_p$
- Settling time $t_s$
- Steady-state error $e_{ss}$

Use this lens when requirements are written in plain performance language.

## Lens 2: Bode (frequency domain)

Best for answering:

- How robust is loop near instability?
- Is bandwidth high enough for speed?
- Is high-frequency noise amplification a risk?

Typical quantities:

- Crossover frequency $\omega_{gc}$
- Phase margin (PM)
- Gain margin (GM)
- High-frequency slope

Use this lens for tuning controller shape (gain, lead, lag, PID effects).

## Lens 3: Nyquist (complex-plane geometry)

Best for answering:

- Is closed loop stable given open-loop RHP poles?
- How close is loop to the critical point $-1+j0$?
- Are delays/model uncertainties creating hidden risk?

Core rule:

<EquationHelp hint="Nyquist links open-loop geometry to closed-loop unstable poles. It is the most general classical frequency-domain stability test.">

$$
N = Z - P
$$

</EquationHelp>

- $N$: clockwise encirclements of $-1+j0$
- $P$: open-loop RHP poles
- $Z$: closed-loop RHP poles

For closed-loop stability, require $Z=0$.

## Side-by-side comparison

| View | Primary input | Primary output | Main strength | Main limitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Step | Time signal step | $y(t)$ trajectory | Directly shows speed/overshoot/settling | Harder to infer robustness margins directly |
| Bode | Sinusoidal sweep | Mag/phase vs frequency | Great for tuning and margin targets | Indirect link to time metrics |
| Nyquist | Frequency sweep in complex plane | Encirclement + distance to $-1$ | Most explicit stability geometry | Less intuitive for beginners at first |

## How to translate between the three views

Use these practical trend rules (not exact laws for every plant):

1. Higher crossover often means faster rise time.
2. Larger phase margin often means less overshoot.
3. Nyquist curve passing close to $-1$ often means poor damping/robustness.
4. Stable Nyquist does not guarantee "good" transient shape; step must still be checked.

A common beginner-safe target zone:

- PM around 45 to 60 deg
- reasonable crossover for desired speed
- Nyquist with clear separation from $-1$

Then verify with step response and disturbance tests.

## Worked Example (conceptual tuning loop)

Suppose your step response is:

- too oscillatory,
- overshoot about 30%,
- settling slower than required.

You inspect Bode and find:

- low phase margin (around 25 to 30 deg),
- crossover slightly lower than desired.

Nyquist shows:

- no forbidden encirclement (stable),
- but curve passes very near $-1+j0$ (fragile relative stability).

Interpretation:

- System is stable but weakly damped and not robust.

Action:

1. Add phase lead near crossover (or retune PID derivative effect).
2. Increase PM toward safer range.
3. Re-check Nyquist separation from $-1$.
4. Re-simulate step response to confirm overshoot/settling improvement.

This is the practical three-lens design loop.

- [Module 3.5 Routh and Nyquist](/syllabus/3-5-routh-nyquist)

## Common Mistakes

- Treating a stable Nyquist plot as "done" without checking step quality.
- Tuning only for fast rise time and ignoring PM/GM.
- Reading Bode magnitude only and forgetting phase.
- Assuming PM-to-overshoot relation is exact for all higher-order plants.
- Ignoring disturbance rejection while focusing only on command tracking.

## Detailed Review

Before moving on, make sure you can answer:

1. What does Step tell you that Bode does not directly show?
2. Why can a system be stable in Nyquist but still poorly damped?
3. Which Bode quantities most influence transient quality?
4. Why should you check all three views before final tuning?

## Assignments

1. Pick one transfer function from your notes and compute/estimate:
   step response metrics, Bode PM/GM, and Nyquist stability condition.
2. Change gain and describe how all three views shift.
3. Propose one compensator change and predict effects in all three views before simulating.
