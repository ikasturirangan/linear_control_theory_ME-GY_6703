# 3.9 State-Transition Matrix and State-Space Representation

## Learning Outcomes

1. Write state-space models in standard form.
2. Interpret state-transition matrix physically and mathematically.
3. Compute state trajectories with and without input.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| State vector $x$ | Minimum internal variables needed to predict future behavior. |
| State matrix $A$ | Internal dynamics matrix. |
| Input matrix $B$ | How control input affects state change. |
| Output matrix $C$ | How states map to measured outputs. |
| State-transition matrix $\\Phi(t)$ | Matrix exponential governing free state evolution. |

## Explanation

This chapter introduces the modern control language for multivariable systems.
It replaces single transfer-function view with a structured internal-state view.

## Standard state-space model

<EquationHelp hint="State equation governs internal dynamics. Output equation maps internal state to measurable quantities.">

$$
\dot{x}=Ax+Bu,\qquad y=Cx+Du
$$

</EquationHelp>

## State-transition matrix

For time-invariant $A$:

$$
\Phi(t)=e^{At}
$$

Solution form:

$$
x(t)=\Phi(t)x(0)+\int_0^t \Phi(t-\tau)Bu(\tau)d\tau
$$

Interpretation:

- First term: free/natural evolution from initial state.
- Integral term: forced contribution from input.

## Why this matters

State-space is essential for:

- MIMO systems
- Observer design
- Modern optimal control (LQR/MPC)

## Plain-English state interpretation

A state is the minimum memory the system needs to predict its future.
For a mass-spring-damper, common states are position and velocity.
Once current state and input are known, future trajectory is determined by dynamics.

This is why state-space scales better than transfer functions for multivariable systems.

## Common Mistakes

- Choosing states that are not independent.
- Confusing measured outputs with full state vector.
- Ignoring physical meaning of each state and treating matrices as pure algebra.

## Worked Example

For diagonal

$$
A=\mathrm{diag}(-1,-3)
$$

the state-transition matrix is:

$$
\Phi(t)=\mathrm{diag}(e^{-t},e^{-3t})
$$

which shows the second state decays faster.

## Detailed Review

Ensure you can:

1. Explain why state-space is preferred for MIMO systems.
2. Separate free response from forced response in the solution formula.
3. Map each matrix ($A,B,C,D$) to physical meaning.

## Assignments

Skills tested: `derivation`, `interpretation`, `stability test`, `design choice`.

For diagonal $A=\text{diag}(-1,-3)$, compute $\Phi(t)$ and explain which state decays faster.
