# 3.9 State-Transition Matrix and State-Space Representation

## Learning goals

1. Write state-space models in standard form.
2. Interpret state-transition matrix physically and mathematically.
3. Compute state trajectories with and without input.

## Standard state-space model

<EquationHelp hint="State equation governs internal dynamics. Output equation maps internal state to measurable quantities.">

$$
\dot{x}=Ax+Bu,\qquad y=Cx+Du
$$

</EquationHelp>

## State-transition matrix

For time-invariant $A$:

$$
\Phi(t)=e^{At}
$$

Solution form:

$$
x(t)=\Phi(t)x(0)+\int_0^t \Phi(t-\tau)Bu(\tau)d\tau
$$

Interpretation:

- First term: free/natural evolution from initial state.
- Integral term: forced contribution from input.

## Why this matters

State-space is essential for:

- MIMO systems
- Observer design
- Modern optimal control (LQR/MPC)

## Plain-English state interpretation

A state is the minimum memory the system needs to predict its future.
For a mass-spring-damper, common states are position and velocity.
Once current state and input are known, future trajectory is determined by dynamics.

This is why state-space scales better than transfer functions for multivariable systems.

## Common beginner mistakes

- Choosing states that are not independent.
- Confusing measured outputs with full state vector.
- Ignoring physical meaning of each state and treating matrices as pure algebra.

## Try it now

For diagonal $A=\text{diag}(-1,-3)$, compute $\Phi(t)$ and explain which state decays faster.
