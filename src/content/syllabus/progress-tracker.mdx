Use this tracker to monitor completion of all modules and the lab.

<SyllabusTracker />

## How to interpret progress

- 0-30%: Foundation stage (modules 3.1-3.4)
- 31-70%: Core stability and digital stage (modules 3.5-3.10)
- 71-100%: Advanced design stage (modules 3.11-3.13 + lab)

## Study discipline tips

1. Do not mark complete until you can explain key equations in your own words.
2. Re-open modules with weak quiz performance.
3. Before exams, ensure all modules are complete and reviewed at least once.
