# Progress Tracker

Use this tracker to monitor completion of all modules and the lab.

<SyllabusTracker />

## How to interpret progress

- 0-30%: Foundation stage (weeks 1-4)
- 31-70%: Core classical + digital stage (weeks 5-10)
- 71-100%: Modern design + lab completion (weeks 11-14)

The tracker shows both:

1. Module completion percentage
2. Hours completion percentage (out of 41 total hours)

## Study discipline tips

1. Do not mark complete until you can explain key equations in your own words.
2. Re-open modules with weak quiz performance.
3. Before exams, ensure all modules are complete and reviewed at least once.
