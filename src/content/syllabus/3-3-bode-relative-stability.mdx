# 3.3 Bode Plot and Relative Stability

## Learning goals

1. Read magnitude and phase plots correctly.
2. Estimate gain crossover, phase crossover, and margins.
3. Interpret relative stability from frequency-domain plots.

## Why relative stability matters

Absolute stability asks: stable or unstable?
Relative stability asks: how safely stable is it?

Margins provide robustness buffer against modeling uncertainty.

## Bode fundamentals

<EquationHelp hint="Magnitude in dB maps multiplicative gain into additive scale; this makes asymptotic shaping easier.">

$$
|G(j\omega)|_{dB}=20\log_{10}|G(j\omega)|
$$

</EquationHelp>

<EquationHelp hint="Phase lag accumulation near crossover strongly influences oscillation tendency.">

$$
\phi(\omega)=\angle G(j\omega)
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Key quantities

- Gain crossover $\omega_{gc}$: where magnitude is 0 dB.
- Phase margin (PM): $180^\circ+\angle G(j\omega_{gc})$.
- Gain margin (GM): inverse gain at phase crossover.

Larger positive margins generally imply better robustness.

## Relative stability interpretation

- Small PM: oscillatory or underdamped response risk.
- Large PM: usually smoother transient, lower bandwidth.
- Tradeoff: speed vs robustness.

## How to read a Bode plot in 90 seconds

1. Find where magnitude crosses 0 dB -> this is crossover region.
2. Read phase around that frequency.
3. Estimate PM from distance to $-180^\circ$.
4. Check high-frequency magnitude slope to judge noise sensitivity.

This quick scan gives a practical stability + robustness assessment without full simulation.

## Common interpretation mistakes

- Treating PM as an absolute guarantee (nonlinearities and delays can still destabilize).
- Ignoring model uncertainty near crossover.
- Increasing gain to \"speed up\" without re-checking PM/GM.
- Looking only at magnitude and forgetting phase.

## Try it now

For a given Bode plot, estimate PM and answer:

1. Is the loop likely oscillatory?
2. Would increasing gain help or hurt margins?
