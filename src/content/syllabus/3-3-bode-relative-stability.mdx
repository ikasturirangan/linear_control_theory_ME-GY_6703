# 3.3 Bode Plot and Relative Stability

## Learning Outcomes

1. Read magnitude and phase plots correctly.
2. Estimate gain crossover, phase crossover, and margins.
3. Interpret relative stability from frequency-domain plots.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Bode plot | Frequency response represented as magnitude and phase vs frequency. |
| Gain crossover | Frequency where magnitude is 0 dB. |
| Phase margin (PM) | Distance to $-180^\circ$ phase at gain crossover. |
| Gain margin (GM) | Extra gain before instability at phase crossover. |
| Relative stability | How robustly stable a loop is, not just stable/unstable. |

## Explanation

This chapter reframes stability as a robustness problem.
Instead of only checking poles, you evaluate how much uncertainty the loop can tolerate using margins.

## Why relative stability matters

Absolute stability asks: stable or unstable?
Relative stability asks: how safely stable is it?

Margins provide robustness buffer against modeling uncertainty.

## Bode fundamentals

<EquationHelp hint="Magnitude in dB maps multiplicative gain into additive scale; this makes asymptotic shaping easier.">

$$
|G(j\omega)|_{dB}=20\log_{10}|G(j\omega)|
$$

</EquationHelp>

<EquationHelp hint="Phase lag accumulation near crossover strongly influences oscillation tendency.">

$$
\phi(\omega)=\angle G(j\omega)
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Key quantities

- Gain crossover $\omega_{gc}$: where magnitude is 0 dB.
- Phase margin (PM): $180^\circ+\angle G(j\omega_{gc})$.
- Gain margin (GM): inverse gain at phase crossover.

Larger positive margins generally imply better robustness.

## Relative stability interpretation

- Small PM: oscillatory or underdamped response risk.
- Large PM: usually smoother transient, lower bandwidth.
- Tradeoff: speed vs robustness.

## How to read a Bode plot in 90 seconds

1. Find where magnitude crosses 0 dB -> this is crossover region.
2. Read phase around that frequency.
3. Estimate PM from distance to $-180^\circ$.
4. Check high-frequency magnitude slope to judge noise sensitivity.

This quick scan gives a practical stability + robustness assessment without full simulation.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating PM as an absolute guarantee (nonlinearities and delays can still destabilize).
- Ignoring model uncertainty near crossover.
- Increasing gain to \"speed up\" without re-checking PM/GM.
- Looking only at magnitude and forgetting phase.

## Interactive link

Use [Bode Plot Lab](/interactive/bode-plot-lab) to build intuition with sliders.

## Worked Example

Suppose crossover frequency is where phase is $-140^\circ$.
Then:

$$
\mathrm{PM}=180^\circ-140^\circ=40^\circ
$$

Interpretation: loop is stable but margin is moderate; damping/robustness may be limited.

## Detailed Review

Before moving ahead, verify you can:

1. Estimate $\omega_{gc}$ from magnitude graph.
2. Estimate PM from phase at $\omega_{gc}$.
3. Explain speed vs robustness tradeoff in one paragraph.

## Assignments

For a given Bode plot, estimate PM and answer:

1. Is the loop likely oscillatory?
2. Would increasing gain help or hurt margins?
