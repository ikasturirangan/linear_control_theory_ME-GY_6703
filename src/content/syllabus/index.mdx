# Detailed Syllabus Learning Path

This section implements your full syllabus with notes, examples, references, and tracking.
It is designed to take a complete beginner from fundamentals to modern design topics.

## How to use this section

1. Start with [Progress Tracker](/syllabus/progress-tracker).
2. Study each module in order.
3. Complete the module's "Try it now" tasks.
4. Use [Short Forms Index](/syllabus/short-forms-index) whenever acronyms appear.
5. Use [References and Citations](/syllabus/references) for deeper reading.
6. Revisit weak modules before moving to later design modules.

## Zero-background bridge (recommended before Module 3.1)

If you are new to engineering, do this short bridge first:

1. [Absolute Basics](/basics/anatomy)
2. [Block Diagrams Chapter](/block-diagrams)
3. [Transfer Functions for Absolute Beginners](/fundamentals/transfer-functions-beginner)
4. [Poles, Zeros, DC Gain, Relative Degree](/fundamentals/poles-zeros-dc-gain-relative-degree)

| 13 | 3.13 | LQR (linear quadratic regulator), MPC (model predictive control) | 3 |
| 14 | Lab | Controls experiment - Inverted Pendulum Balancing | 2 |

Total instructional time: **41 hours**.

## Prerequisites checklist

- Basic differential equations
- Complex numbers and Euler form
- Matrix multiplication and rank
- Introductory Laplace transform

If any of these are weak, spend extra time on modules 3.1 and 3.9 before advancing.

## Pacing recommendation

Follow the week order above.
If one week feels dense, split into two passes:

1. Concept pass (read + annotate)
2. Retrieval pass (practice without notes)

## Start now

Begin with [3.1 Modeling, ODE, TF, Responses, Simulink](/syllabus/3-1-modeling-ode-transfer-functions).
