# Detailed Syllabus Learning Path

This section implements your full syllabus with notes, examples, references, and tracking.
It is designed to take a complete beginner from fundamentals to modern design topics.

## How to use this section

1. Start with [Progress Tracker](/syllabus/progress-tracker).
2. Study each module in order.
3. Complete the module's "Try it now" tasks.
4. Use [Short Forms Index](/syllabus/short-forms-index) whenever acronyms appear.
5. Use [References and Citations](/syllabus/references) for deeper reading.
6. Revisit weak modules before moving to later design modules.

## Syllabus sequence

| Module | Topic | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.1 | Modeling, ODE, TF, command/disturbance responses, Simulink | Converts physical systems into analyzable models |
| 3.2 | Steady-state error, closed-loop TF, performance | Connects feedback structure to measurable outcomes |
| 3.3 | Bode and relative stability | Introduces frequency-domain robustness thinking |
| 3.4 | Frequency-domain controller design | Turns Bode insight into controller tuning decisions |
| 3.5 | Routh and Nyquist | Formal stability tools for polynomial and loop transfer functions |
| 3.6 | Digital controller representation, difference equations | Bridges continuous ideas to implementable digital logic |
| 3.7 | Jury test, sampled-data systems, Z-transform | Provides discrete-time stability and analysis framework |
| 3.8 | Sampling, ZOH, A/D and D/A | Explains practical interface between software and physical plant |
| 3.9 | State-transition matrix, state-space representation | Enables multivariable and modern control formulations |
| 3.10 | Continuous-to-discrete conversion, DTSS | Required for real digital controller deployment |
| 3.11 | Controllability, observability, Ackermann | Determines what can be controlled/estimated and how |
| 3.12 | Pole placement, full-state observer | Core design tools in state-space |
| 3.13 | LQR and MPC | Introduces optimization-based modern controllers |
| Lab | Inverted pendulum balancing | Integrates modeling, control design, estimation, and implementation |

## Prerequisites checklist

- Basic differential equations
- Complex numbers and Euler form
- Matrix multiplication and rank
- Introductory Laplace transform

If any of these are weak, spend extra time on modules 3.1 and 3.9 before advancing.
