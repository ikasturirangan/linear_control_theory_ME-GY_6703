# Capstone Prep Pack - Inverted Pendulum

## Objective

Prepare for the lab with a structured pre-check so hardware time is efficient and safe.

## Pre-lab technical checklist

1. Re-derive linearized model around upright equilibrium.
2. Confirm state definitions and sensor mappings.
3. Validate controllability and observability from identified parameters.
4. Choose initial controller method (pole placement or LQR).
5. Choose observer strategy if all states are not measured.
6. Select sample period and justify it with bandwidth/margin logic.

## Simulation checklist

- Include actuator saturation.
- Include sensor noise.
- Include disturbance impulse and parameter uncertainty.
- Compare nominal vs +10% and -10% parameter variants.

## Hardware readiness checklist

- Emergency stop tested.
- Sign conventions verified (sensor and control direction).
- Actuator limits enforced in software.
- Safe initial conditions set.

## What to document during runs

- Gains/weights used.
- Sample time.
- Settling time and overshoot trend.
- Disturbance recovery quality.
- Failure observations and corrective changes.

## Mini rubric for final report

- Model validity and assumptions clearly justified.
- Controller and observer design traceable from theory.
- Simulation-to-experiment comparison included.
- Failure analysis and next-step improvements included.
