# 3.12 Pole-Placement Controller Design and Full-State Observer Design

## Learning Outcomes

1. Design state-feedback gain $K$ for desired closed-loop poles.
2. Design observer gain $L$ for state estimation.
3. Understand separation principle in controller+observer design.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Pole placement | Choosing controller poles to shape closed-loop behavior. |
| State feedback | Control law based on state vector, often $u=-Kx+Nr$. |
| Observer | Dynamic estimator that reconstructs states from outputs. |
| Separation principle | Independent controller and observer design validity under standard assumptions. |
| Estimation error | Difference between true state and estimated state. |

## Explanation

This chapter combines control and estimation into a complete practical architecture.
You design how system behaves and how hidden states are reconstructed.

## Controller design

Use control law:

$$
u=-Kx+Nr
$$

Closed-loop matrix becomes $A-BK$.
Choose poles of $A-BK$ to meet speed/damping goals.

## Observer design

When full state is not measured, use estimator:

$$
\dot{\hat{x}}=A\hat{x}+Bu+L(y-C\hat{x})
$$

Estimation error dynamics:

$$
\dot{e}=(A-LC)e
$$

Choose observer poles faster than controller poles (common rule: 2-5x).

## Separation principle

If system is controllable and observable:

- Controller poles can be designed via $K$.
- Observer poles can be designed via $L$.
- Combined design remains valid under separation principle.

## Why observer poles are usually faster

Observer must estimate states quickly enough for controller to act on accurate information.
If observer is too slow, controller behaves as if it is using stale state data.
If observer is too fast, noise can be amplified.

So practical design balances estimation speed and noise sensitivity.

## Practical design checklist

1. Verify controllability and observability first.
2. Place controller poles for target transient behavior.
3. Place observer poles moderately faster (often 2x-5x).
4. Simulate with sensor noise and disturbances.
5. Retune if noise amplification is excessive.

## Common Mistakes

- Designing controller poles before verifying controllability.
- Placing observer poles excessively fast and amplifying measurement noise.
- Ignoring estimator initial-condition effects in transient behavior.
- Treating separation principle as immunity to bad modeling assumptions.

## Worked Example

For a 2-state plant:

1. place controller poles at moderate stable values,
2. place observer poles 2x-3x faster,
3. compare output tracking with full-state measurement vs observer-based implementation.

## Detailed Review

Make sure you can discuss:

1. Why observer dynamics should usually be faster than controller dynamics.
2. How noise sensitivity appears when observer is too aggressive.
3. Why controller+observer must be tested together in simulation.

## Assignments

Skills tested: `derivation`, `interpretation`, `stability test`, `design choice`.

1. Pick controller poles for a 2-state plant.
2. Pick observer poles 3x faster.
3. Compare output response with/without observer.
