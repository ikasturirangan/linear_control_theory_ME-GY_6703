# 3.12 Pole-Placement Controller Design and Full-State Observer Design

## Learning goals

1. Design state-feedback gain $K$ for desired closed-loop poles.
2. Design observer gain $L$ for state estimation.
3. Understand separation principle in controller+observer design.

## Controller design

Use control law:

$$
u=-Kx+Nr
$$

Closed-loop matrix becomes $A-BK$.
Choose poles of $A-BK$ to meet speed/damping goals.

## Observer design

When full state is not measured, use estimator:

$$
\dot{\hat{x}}=A\hat{x}+Bu+L(y-C\hat{x})
$$

Estimation error dynamics:

$$
\dot{e}=(A-LC)e
$$

Choose observer poles faster than controller poles (common rule: 2-5x).

## Separation principle

If system is controllable and observable:

- Controller poles can be designed via $K$.
- Observer poles can be designed via $L$.
- Combined design remains valid under separation principle.

## Why observer poles are usually faster

Observer must estimate states quickly enough for controller to act on accurate information.
If observer is too slow, controller behaves as if it is using stale state data.
If observer is too fast, noise can be amplified.

So practical design balances estimation speed and noise sensitivity.

## Practical design checklist

1. Verify controllability and observability first.
2. Place controller poles for target transient behavior.
3. Place observer poles moderately faster (often 2x-5x).
4. Simulate with sensor noise and disturbances.
5. Retune if noise amplification is excessive.

## Try it now

1. Pick controller poles for a 2-state plant.
2. Pick observer poles 3x faster.
3. Compare output response with/without observer.
