# 3.7 Jury Stability Test, Sampled-data Control Systems, Z-Transform

## Learning goals

1. Use Z-transform for discrete-time system analysis.
2. Apply Jury stability test for polynomial roots inside unit circle.
3. Understand sampled-data loop structure.

## Z-transform foundation

<EquationHelp hint="Z-transform plays the same role in discrete time that Laplace transform plays in continuous time.">

$$
X(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x[k]z^{-k}
$$

</EquationHelp>

Poles of discrete system must lie inside unit circle for asymptotic stability.

## Jury test intuition

For characteristic polynomial in $z$:

$$
P(z)=a_0z^n+a_1z^{n-1}+\dots+a_n
$$

Jury provides tabular inequalities equivalent to all roots satisfying $|z_i|<1$.

Use Jury when direct root solving is cumbersome.

## Sampled-data loop

A sampled-data system includes:

- Continuous plant
- Sampler (A/D)
- Digital controller
- Hold element (D/A with ZOH)

Overall behavior depends on both plant dynamics and sampling/hold effects.

## Stability intuition in one line

Continuous-time stability checks whether poles lie in LHP.
Discrete-time stability checks whether poles lie **inside the unit circle**.
Jury test is a structured way to verify that without solving roots explicitly.

## Why this module feels hard at first

Students are learning three shifts simultaneously:

1. time variable changes from $t$ to index $k$,
2. transform changes from Laplace to Z-transform,
3. stability region changes from LHP to unit circle.

If you treat these as a direct dictionary, confusion drops quickly.

## Common mistakes

- Mixing $s$-domain and $z$-domain formulas in the same derivation.
- Interpreting $|z|<1$ incorrectly as \"real part < 0\".
- Skipping sampling/hold effects in loop analysis.

## Try it now

For a second-order discrete polynomial, check unit-circle stability by both root calculation and Jury steps.
