# 3.7 Jury Stability Test, Sampled-data Control Systems, Z-Transform

## Learning Outcomes

1. Use Z-transform for discrete-time system analysis.
2. Apply Jury stability test for polynomial roots inside unit circle.
3. Understand sampled-data loop structure.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Z-transform | Discrete-time transform representation of sequences. |
| Unit circle | Stability boundary in discrete-time pole map. |
| Jury test | Tabular stability test for roots inside unit circle. |
| Sampled-data system | Hybrid loop with continuous plant + sampled controller path. |
| ZOH | Zero-order hold between digital commands and continuous plant input. |

## Explanation

This chapter is the discrete-time counterpart of Laplace-domain stability analysis.
It teaches how sampling changes both math language and stability geometry.

## Z-transform foundation

<EquationHelp hint="Z-transform plays the same role in discrete time that Laplace transform plays in continuous time.">

$$
X(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x[k]z^{-k}
$$

</EquationHelp>

Poles of discrete system must lie inside unit circle for asymptotic stability.

## Jury test intuition

For characteristic polynomial in $z$:

$$
P(z)=a_0z^n+a_1z^{n-1}+\dots+a_n
$$

Jury provides tabular inequalities equivalent to all roots satisfying $|z_i|<1$.

Use Jury when direct root solving is cumbersome.

## Sampled-data loop

A sampled-data system includes:

- Continuous plant
- Sampler (A/D)
- Digital controller
- Hold element (D/A with ZOH)

Overall behavior depends on both plant dynamics and sampling/hold effects.

## Stability intuition in one line

Continuous-time stability checks whether poles lie in LHP.
Discrete-time stability checks whether poles lie **inside the unit circle**.
Jury test is a structured way to verify that without solving roots explicitly.

## Why this module feels hard at first

Students are learning three shifts simultaneously:

1. time variable changes from $t$ to index $k$,
2. transform changes from Laplace to Z-transform,
3. stability region changes from LHP to unit circle.

If you treat these as a direct dictionary, confusion drops quickly.

## Common Mistakes

- Mixing $s$-domain and $z$-domain formulas in the same derivation.
- Interpreting $|z|<1$ incorrectly as \"real part < 0\".
- Skipping sampling/hold effects in loop analysis.

## Worked Example

For a second-order polynomial in $z$, compute its roots numerically and verify whether each satisfies $|z_i|<1$.
Then perform Jury steps to confirm the same conclusion.

## Detailed Review

Check you can clearly state:

1. How Laplace and Z-transform roles are analogous.
2. Why unit-circle criterion replaces LHP criterion.
3. Why sampled-data modeling needs sampler + hold blocks explicitly.

## Assignments

Skills tested: `derivation`, `interpretation`, `stability test`, `design choice`.

For a second-order discrete polynomial, check unit-circle stability by both root calculation and Jury steps.
Compare results.
