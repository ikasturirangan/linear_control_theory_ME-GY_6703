# 3.11 Controllability, Observability, Ackermann's Formula

## Learning goals

1. Test controllability and observability with rank checks.
2. Understand why these are prerequisites for state-space design.
3. Apply Ackermann's formula for pole placement in SISO systems.

## Controllability and observability tests

$$
\mathcal{C}=[B\ AB\ A^2B\ \dots\ A^{n-1}B]
$$

$$
\mathcal{O}=\begin{bmatrix}C\\CA\\CA^2\\\vdots\\CA^{n-1}\end{bmatrix}
$$

Need full rank $n$ for each property.

## Why this is non-negotiable

- Not controllable -> some modes cannot be moved by input.
- Not observable -> some modes cannot be reconstructed from output.

Any pole-placement/observer design without these checks is invalid.

## Physical intuition

- Controllability asks: can actuators move every dynamic mode?
- Observability asks: can sensors reveal every dynamic mode?

If answer is no for either, some desired behaviors are mathematically unreachable regardless of tuning effort.

## Ackermann formula (SISO)

For controllable pair $(A,B)$:

$$
K = e_n^T\mathcal{C}^{-1}\phi(A)
$$

where $\phi(A)$ is desired characteristic polynomial evaluated at $A$.

## Common pitfalls

- Applying Ackermann to non-controllable systems.
- Numerical issues from directly inverting ill-conditioned controllability matrix.
- Choosing unrealistic desired poles (too fast for actuator/sensor limits).

## Try it now

For a 2-state system, compute $\mathcal{C}$ rank before applying Ackermann.
Then place poles at chosen stable locations.
