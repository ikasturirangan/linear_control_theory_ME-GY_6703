# 3.10 Continuous-to-Discrete Conversion and DTSS

## Learning goals

1. Convert continuous state-space models to discrete-time state-space (DTSS).
2. Understand exact ZOH discretization formulas.
3. Interpret discretization effects on poles and dynamics.

## DTSS form

$$
x[k+1]=A_d x[k]+B_d u[k],\qquad y[k]=C_d x[k]+D_d u[k]
$$

## Exact ZOH conversion

For sample period $T_s$:

$$
A_d=e^{AT_s}
$$

$$
B_d=\int_0^{T_s} e^{A\tau}B\,d\tau
$$

and typically $C_d=C$, $D_d=D$ for straightforward sampling.

## Pole mapping intuition

Continuous pole $s_i$ maps to discrete pole:

$$
z_i=e^{s_iT_s}
$$

So LHP in $s$-plane maps inside unit circle in $z$-plane.

## Why this conversion is essential

Even if plant physics is continuous, real controllers are digital.
So every practical design eventually needs $(A,B,C,D) \\to (A_d,B_d,C_d,D_d)$ conversion.

Without this step, simulation and real implementation can diverge significantly.

## Practical notes

- Exact ZOH discretization is preferred for implementation-accurate modeling.
- Approximate methods can be useful for hand analysis but must be validated.
- Sampling period choice directly changes discrete pole location and margin.

## Try it now

Take $s=-2\pm j$ with $T_s=0.1$.
Compute $z=e^{sT_s}$ and verify magnitude is less than 1.
