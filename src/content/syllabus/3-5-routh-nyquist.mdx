# 3.5 Routh Stability Criterion and Nyquist Diagram

## Learning Outcomes

1. Use Routh table for polynomial stability.
2. Interpret Nyquist encirclement criterion.
3. Connect both methods to the same stability question.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Characteristic polynomial | Denominator polynomial determining closed-loop poles. |
| Routh table | Tabular method to count RHP roots without solving roots explicitly. |
| Nyquist plot | Complex-plane trace of $L(j\omega)$. |
| Encirclement | Number/direction of loops around critical point $-1+j0$. |
| RHP | Right-half plane, unstable side for continuous-time poles. |

## Explanation

This chapter gives two complementary stability tools:
one algebraic (Routh) and one frequency-domain geometric (Nyquist).

## Routh criterion (polynomial method)

Given characteristic polynomial:

$$
a_n s^n + a_{n-1}s^{n-1} + \dots + a_0 = 0
$$

Routh tells number of right-half-plane roots from sign changes in first column.

### Beginner checklist

1. Write polynomial in descending powers.
2. Build first two rows.
3. Compute remaining rows.
4. Count first-column sign changes.

## Nyquist criterion (frequency response method)

Nyquist plots $L(j\omega)=G(j\omega)H(j\omega)$ in complex plane.
Stability from encirclement of $-1+j0$:

$$
N = Z - P
$$

- $N$: clockwise encirclements of -1
- $P$: open-loop RHP poles
- $Z$: closed-loop RHP poles

Closed-loop stable requires $Z=0$.

## Why learn both

- Routh: quick for parametric polynomial checks.
- Nyquist: powerful with delays and frequency-shaped models.

## Same system, three views

After Nyquist/Routh stability check, verify the same loop through:

1. step response quality,
2. Bode margins,
3. Nyquist geometry around `-1`.

Use [Step vs Bode vs Nyquist (Detailed Comparison)](/fundamentals/step-bode-nyquist-comparison) for the full bridge.

## When to choose which method

- Use **Routh** when you have an explicit characteristic polynomial and want fast stable-parameter ranges.
- Use **Nyquist** when you care about loop-shape robustness, delays, or frequency-domain uncertainty.

They answer the same stability question from different views, so using both on the same problem builds confidence.

## Common Mistakes

- Building Routh rows with incorrect column alignment.
- Forgetting that zero in first column needs special handling.
- Miscounting Nyquist encirclement direction (clockwise vs counterclockwise).
- Ignoring open-loop RHP poles when applying $N=Z-P$.

## Worked Example

For:

$$
s^3+2s^2+3s+K=0
$$

Build Routh first-column terms and find the interval of $K$ where no sign changes occur.
This interval is the stable parameter region.

## Detailed Review

Ensure you can articulate:

1. Why sign changes in Routh first column imply RHP roots.
2. What each variable in $N=Z-P$ means physically.
3. When Nyquist is preferred over pure polynomial tests.

## Assignments

Skills tested: `derivation`, `interpretation`, `stability test`, `design choice`.

1. Build Routh table for $s^3+2s^2+3s+K=0$ and find stable $K$ range.
2. For an open-loop with one RHP pole, determine required Nyquist encirclement for closed-loop stability.
