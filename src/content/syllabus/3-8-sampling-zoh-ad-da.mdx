# 3.8 Sampling, Zero-order Hold, A/D and D/A Converters

## Learning Outcomes

1. Explain sampling period impact on control quality.
2. Model ZOH behavior in digital control loops.
3. Understand practical effects of ADC/DAC quantization and delay.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Sampling period $T_s$ | Time between controller updates. |
| ZOH | Hold block that keeps command constant between updates. |
| ADC | Analog-to-digital converter for measurements. |
| DAC | Digital-to-analog converter for actuation signal. |
| Quantization | Discretization of continuous values into finite levels. |

## Explanation

This chapter explains hardware reality.
Even perfect controller equations can fail if sampling and converter effects are ignored.

## Sampling basics

Continuous signal $x(t)$ sampled every $T_s$ gives sequence $x[k]=x(kT_s)$.

Choosing $T_s$ too large can degrade phase margin and tracking.

Common heuristic: sample at least 10-20x faster than desired closed-loop bandwidth.

## Zero-order hold (ZOH)

DAC with ZOH holds each sample constant between updates.
Equivalent hold transfer function:

$$
G_{ZOH}(s)=\frac{1-e^{-sT_s}}{s}
$$

ZOH introduces additional phase lag at higher frequencies.

## Practical converter effects

- ADC quantization: measurement granularity limits.
- ADC/DAC conversion delay: effective phase lag.
- Saturation/clipping at converter bounds.

All three can reduce achievable performance if ignored in design.

## Choosing sample time (practical rule)

Start with:

- sampling frequency at least 10x closed-loop bandwidth (minimum),
- preferably 20x when computation budget allows.

Then verify by simulation and experimental step tests.
If oscillation appears after digital implementation, sampling/latency is a prime suspect.

## Quantization intuition

ADC quantization turns smooth analog measurements into staircase levels.
If resolution is too low, small errors can disappear, causing limit cycles or noisy control action.

## Common Mistakes

- Designing a controller in continuous time and deploying directly without discretization checks.
- Ignoring computational delay in control loop timing.
- Treating converter dynamics as negligible in fast systems.

## Worked Example

Run the same closed-loop design at $T_s$, $2T_s$, and $4T_s$.
Observe that increasing $T_s$ usually increases lag and can reduce damping margin.

## Detailed Review

Make sure you can explain:

1. Why ZOH adds effective phase lag.
2. Why converter delay matters for fast loops.
3. Why sample-time selection is a control-design decision, not only a coding decision.

## Assignments

Skills tested: `derivation`, `interpretation`, `stability test`, `design choice`.

Simulate the same loop with $T_s$, $2T_s$, and $4T_s$.
Observe changes in overshoot and settling behavior.
