# 3.2 Steady-State Error, Closed-Loop Transfer Function, Performance

## Learning Outcomes

1. Derive closed-loop transfer function.
2. Compute steady-state error with final value theorem.
3. Relate damping and natural frequency to performance metrics.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| CLTF | Closed-loop transfer function, output/reference map with feedback closed. |
| SSE | Steady-state error, long-time tracking error. |
| FVT | Final value theorem for long-time value extraction in Laplace domain. |
| System type | Number of open-loop integrators; predicts steady-state tracking class. |

## Explanation

This chapter answers two practical questions:

1. What does feedback make the system do mathematically?
2. How much final error remains after transient behavior settles?

## Closed-loop transfer function

For negative feedback:

<EquationHelp hint="This is the core closed-loop map. Denominator term controls stability and transient behavior.">

$$
T(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)H(s)}
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Error transfer function

<EquationHelp hint="Error is not an abstract signal. It is what the controller acts on. Minimizing this is the control objective.">

$$
\frac{E(s)}{R(s)}=\frac{1}{1+G(s)H(s)}
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Steady-state error (SSE)

Use final value theorem for stable closed-loop systems:

<EquationHelp hint="SSE is the long-term error after transients die out. Always verify closed-loop stability first.">

$$
e_{ss}=\lim_{t\to\infty} e(t)=\lim_{s\to0} sE(s)
$$

</EquationHelp>

### Static error constants (unity feedback)

- $K_p=\lim_{s\to0}G(s)$ for step input
- $K_v=\lim_{s\to0}sG(s)$ for ramp input
- $K_a=\lim_{s\to0}s^2G(s)$ for parabolic input

## Performance metrics refresher

- Rise time
- Settling time
- Overshoot
- Steady-state error

All four should be considered together; optimizing one can hurt others.

## Step-by-step SSE recipe (beginner-safe)

When you get an SSE question, follow this exact order:

1. Write loop transfer function (usually $G(s)H(s)$).
2. Confirm closed-loop stability assumption.
3. Write $E(s)$ from input type (step/ramp/parabolic).
4. Apply $e_{ss}=\lim_{s\to0}sE(s)$.
5. Simplify slowly and only then substitute limits.

This avoids most algebra and sign errors in exam settings.

## Why system type matters

System type equals number of pure integrators in open-loop transfer function.
It predicts which input classes can be tracked with zero SSE:

- Type 0: finite step SSE, infinite ramp SSE.
- Type 1: zero step SSE, finite ramp SSE.
- Type 2: zero step and ramp SSE, finite parabolic SSE.

So \"performance\" is not only overshoot/speed; it also includes which references are trackable.

## Same system, three views

After computing SSE and transient behavior here, cross-check the same loop with:

- Bode margins (robustness buffer),
- Nyquist geometry near `-1` (stability reserve).

Use [Step vs Bode vs Nyquist (Detailed Comparison)](/fundamentals/step-bode-nyquist-comparison).

## Common Mistakes

- Applying final value theorem without checking closed-loop stability assumptions.
- Mixing $E(s)$ and $Y(s)$ expressions during derivation.
- Forgetting input type (step vs ramp) when calculating SSE.
- Misidentifying system type by counting poles instead of integrators at origin.

## Worked Example

For unity feedback with:

$$
G(s)=\frac{5}{s(s+1)}
$$

- Closed-loop map:
  $$
  T(s)=\frac{5}{s(s+1)+5}
  $$
- System type: 1 (one pole at origin in open loop).
- Step SSE: 0.
- Ramp SSE: finite and equals $1/K_v$ with $K_v=\lim_{s\to0}sG(s)=5$.

## Detailed Review

Check you can confidently explain:

1. Why CLTF denominator is the stability-critical polynomial.
2. Why system type predicts SSE class.
3. How SSE and transient metrics describe different performance dimensions.

## Assignments

Skills tested: `derivation`, `interpretation`, `stability test`, `design choice`.

For $G(s)=\frac{10}{s(s+2)}$ (unity feedback):

1. Write $T(s)$.
2. Determine system type.
3. Compute SSE for step and ramp inputs.
