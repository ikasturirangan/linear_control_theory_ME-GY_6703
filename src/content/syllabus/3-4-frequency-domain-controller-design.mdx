# 3.4 Frequency-domain Controller Design

## Learning goals

1. Translate performance targets into Bode-shaping goals.
2. Understand lead, lag, and PI/PID effects in frequency domain.
3. Iterate controller tuning with margin checks.

## Design workflow

1. Start with uncompensated Bode plot.
2. Set target crossover frequency from speed requirement.
3. Add phase lead to increase PM near crossover.
4. Add lag/integral action for low-frequency accuracy.
5. Re-check PM, GM, and bandwidth.

## Controller intuition

### Lead compensation

- Increases phase near crossover.
- Can improve PM and transient damping.
- Often increases noise sensitivity at high frequency.

### Lag compensation

- Increases low-frequency loop gain.
- Helps steady-state accuracy.
- Usually lowers bandwidth.

### PID perspective

- P sets primary gain level.
- I reduces SSE (boosts low frequency gain).
- D adds phase lead around design band.

## Practical design caution

Do not optimize only crossover frequency.
Always check actuator limits and measurement noise.

## Translating specs into frequency-domain targets

A practical mapping many beginners use:

- Need faster response -> raise crossover frequency carefully.
- Need less overshoot -> increase phase margin (often with lead).
- Need lower SSE -> increase low-frequency loop gain (often with lag/PI).
- Need lower noise amplification -> reduce high-frequency gain.

The key is balancing these simultaneously rather than maximizing one target.

## Mini tuning loop you can reuse

1. Start with uncompensated plant and measure PM/GM.
2. Add lead for phase deficiency near desired crossover.
3. Add PI/lag only as much as needed for low-frequency accuracy.
4. Re-check margins and simulate with disturbance + measurement noise.
5. Repeat with small parameter changes, not large jumps.

## Try it now

Take a plant with low PM and design a lead compensator that adds about 30 deg phase near crossover.
Then verify margin changes.
