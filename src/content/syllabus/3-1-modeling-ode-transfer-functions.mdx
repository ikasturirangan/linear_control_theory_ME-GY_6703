# 3.1 Modeling, ODE, Transfer Function, Responses, Simulink

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Build an ODE model from physical laws.
2. Convert ODE model to transfer function.
3. Distinguish command response vs disturbance response.
4. Build the same model in Simulink for simulation.

If you are new to engineering notation, start with [Transfer Functions for Absolute Beginners](/fundamentals/transfer-functions-beginner).

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ODE | Ordinary differential equation describing system dynamics in time. |
| TF | Transfer function, typically $G(s)=Y(s)/U(s)$. |
| Command response | Output behavior due to reference input. |
| Disturbance response | Output behavior due to external disturbance input. |
| Simulink | Block-diagram simulation environment used for dynamic models. |

## Explanation

This chapter explains how engineers convert physical intuition into a simulation-ready model.
You begin from physics (ODE), convert to transfer function, then test behavior for commands and disturbances.

## Big picture (for beginners)

Control design starts with a model, not a controller.
If your model is wrong, perfect tuning cannot rescue performance.

## Step 1: Modeling from physics

For many mechanical/thermal/electrical systems, write force/flow balance to get:

<EquationHelp hint="This generic ODE says weighted derivatives of output are driven by weighted derivatives of input.">

$$
a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_0 y = b_m u^{(m)} + \dots + b_0 u
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Step 2: Convert to transfer function

Assuming zero initial conditions:

<EquationHelp hint="Transfer function is the Laplace-domain input-output map used for poles, zeros, and response analysis.">

$$
G(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}
$$

</EquationHelp>

## Command response vs disturbance response

- Command (reference) response: how output follows desired input.
- Disturbance response: how output reacts when external disturbance enters the plant.

Both matter. Fast command tracking with poor disturbance rejection is not good control.

## Simulink workflow

1. Place blocks for transfer function and summing junction.
2. Add Step block for command.
3. Add optional disturbance injection point.
4. Add Scope block for output.
5. Sweep parameters and compare trajectories.

## Worked Example

Mass-spring-damper:

$$
m\ddot{x}+c\dot{x}+kx=f
$$

For $m=1,c=2,k=5$:

$$
G(s)=\frac{X(s)}{F(s)}=\frac{1}{s^2+2s+5}
$$

## Plain-English walkthrough

Think of this module as a 5-step pipeline:

1. **Describe physics**: what stores energy, what dissipates energy, what forces act.
2. **Write ODE**: one equation that captures those effects.
3. **Choose input/output** clearly (this decides your TF meaning).
4. **Convert to TF** to unlock poles, zeros, and response tools.
5. **Simulate** to test whether model behavior matches intuition.

If your simulation and intuition disagree strongly, revisit modeling assumptions before controller design.

## Common Mistakes

- Picking the wrong output variable (for example, displacement instead of measured sensor output).
- Forgetting that TF derivation assumes zero initial conditions.
- Treating disturbance as if it were the command input.
- Using Simulink blocks without writing the underlying equation first.

## Detailed Review

Before moving on, verify you can do these without notes:

1. Write one physical law-based ODE for a simple plant.
2. Convert that ODE to $G(s)$ under zero initial conditions.
3. Explain the difference between command tracking and disturbance rejection.
4. Sketch the corresponding Simulink block structure.

## Assignments

- Derive transfer function for an RC circuit with input voltage and capacitor output.
- In Simulink, compare responses for two damping values.
