# Fundamentals Practice

## Level A (Direct formula use)

1. **F1**: Derive $G(s)=Y(s)/U(s)$ from $(s+4)Y(s)=2U(s)$.
   Skills tested: `derivation`
2. **F2**: For $G(s)=\frac{5}{s^2+3s+2}$, find poles.
   Skills tested: `stability test`
3. **F3**: For $G(s)=\frac{s+1}{s^2+2s+5}$, state number of zeros and poles.
   Skills tested: `derivation`

## Level B (Interpretation and comparison)

4. **F4**: In $G(s)=\frac{K}{\tau s+1}$, what does increasing $\tau$ usually do to response speed?
   Skills tested: `interpretation`

## Level C (Design/tuning reasoning)

5. **F5**: Name one common modeling mistake when forming transfer functions.
   Skills tested: `design choice`
