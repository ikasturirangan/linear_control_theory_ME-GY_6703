# Mistake-Fix Drills

## How to use

Each item contains a typical wrong line from student work.
Your task: identify the mistake and rewrite correctly.

## Drill 1: Wrong error sign

Wrong line:

$$
e(t)=y(t)-r(t)
$$

Task: explain why this is wrong for standard negative feedback and correct it.

## Drill 2: Wrong TF step

Wrong line:

$$
(\tau s+1)Y(s)=KU(s) \Rightarrow G(s)=\tau s+1
$$

Task: identify missing step and derive correct $G(s)$.

## Drill 3: Wrong stability region (discrete)

Wrong claim:

"Discrete-time stability means poles with negative real part."

Task: correct criterion and explain in one sentence.

## Drill 4: Wrong Routh conclusion

Wrong claim:

"No sign changes in Routh second column means stable."

Task: state which column matters and why.

## Drill 5: Wrong controllability test

Wrong line:

"If $\det(A)\ne0$, the system is controllable."

Task: replace with correct controllability condition.
