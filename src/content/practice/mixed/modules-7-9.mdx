   Skills tested: `interpretation`, `stability test`
2. Explain why ZOH is explicitly modeled in digital control loops.  
   Skills tested: `interpretation`
3. For sample period too large, what is the expected qualitative effect on phase margin?  
   Skills tested: `interpretation`, `design choice`
4. Write state-space form for a second-order ODE by defining states $x_1=y$, $x_2=\dot{y}$.  
   Skills tested: `derivation`
5. Explain physical meaning of state-transition matrix in one paragraph.  
   Skills tested: `interpretation`
