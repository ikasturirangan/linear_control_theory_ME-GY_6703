# Modules 4-6 Mixed Set

## Questions

1. You need more phase margin without large low-frequency gain change. Choose lead or lag and justify.  
   Skills tested: `design choice`, `interpretation`
2. Build first-column Routh terms for $s^3+2s^2+3s+K=0$ and state stability condition on $K$.  
   Skills tested: `stability test`, `derivation`
3. For an open-loop with one RHP pole, what Nyquist encirclement count is needed for closed-loop stability?  
   Skills tested: `stability test`
4. Convert $C(z)=\frac{0.5+0.2z^{-1}}{1-0.6z^{-1}}$ to difference-equation form.  
   Skills tested: `derivation`
5. Explain why finite sampling and computational delay can reduce margin.  
   Skills tested: `interpretation`
