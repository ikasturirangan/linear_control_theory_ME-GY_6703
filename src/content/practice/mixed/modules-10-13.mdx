# Modules 10-13 Mixed Set

## Questions

1. Write exact discrete update equation from continuous model under ZOH using $A_d$ and $B_d$.  
   Skills tested: `derivation`
2. Explain why $A_d=I+AT_s$ is not exact in general.  
   Skills tested: `interpretation`
3. State controllability matrix and condition for full-state pole placement feasibility.  
   Skills tested: `derivation`, `stability test`
4. Why are observer poles usually chosen faster than controller poles?  
   Skills tested: `design choice`, `interpretation`
5. Compare LQR and MPC for a constrained actuator system. Which one is more direct and why?  
   Skills tested: `design choice`, `interpretation`
