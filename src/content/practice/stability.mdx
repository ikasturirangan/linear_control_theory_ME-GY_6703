# Stability Practice

## Level A (Direct formula use)

1. **ST1**: Is a continuous-time pole at $s=-0.5$ stable, unstable, or marginal?
   Skills tested: `stability test`
2. **ST2**: Is a continuous-time pole at $s=+0.2$ stable, unstable, or marginal?
   Skills tested: `stability test`
3. **ST3**: In second-order form, what parameter mostly controls overshoot?
   Skills tested: `derivation`
4. **ST4**: For $T_s\approx\frac{4}{\zeta\omega_n}$, what happens to settling time if $\omega_n$ increases and $\zeta$ stays fixed?
   Skills tested: `interpretation`

## Level B (Interpretation and comparison)

5. **ST5**: For unity-feedback $G(s)=\frac{K}{s+1}$, write closed-loop transfer function.
   Skills tested: `derivation`

## Level C (Design/tuning reasoning)

6. **ST6**: If phase at gain crossover is $-140^\circ$, what is approximate phase margin?
   Skills tested: `design choice`
