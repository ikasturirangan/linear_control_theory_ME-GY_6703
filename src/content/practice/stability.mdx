# Stability Practice

## Questions

1. **ST1**: Is a continuous-time pole at $s=-0.5$ stable, unstable, or marginal?
2. **ST2**: Is a continuous-time pole at $s=+0.2$ stable, unstable, or marginal?
3. **ST3**: In second-order form, what parameter mostly controls overshoot?
4. **ST4**: For $T_s\approx\frac{4}{\zeta\omega_n}$, what happens to settling time if $\omega_n$ increases and $\zeta$ stays fixed?
5. **ST5**: For unity-feedback $G(s)=\frac{K}{s+1}$, write closed-loop transfer function.
6. **ST6**: If phase at gain crossover is $-140^\circ$, what is approximate phase margin?
