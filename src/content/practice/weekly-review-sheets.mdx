# Weekly Review Sheets

Use these at the end of each week before moving forward.

## Sheet A (Weeks 1-3)

- Core formulas: ODE -> TF, closed-loop TF, SSE idea, PM basics
- Core intuition: tracking vs disturbance rejection, damping vs speed
- Common traps: wrong error sign, ignored zero initial conditions

## Sheet B (Weeks 4-6)

- Core formulas: lead/lag forms, Routh sign-change rule, Nyquist $N=Z-P$
- Core intuition: robustness margin tradeoffs, algebraic vs geometric stability
- Common traps: miscounted encirclements, gain-only tuning

## Sheet C (Weeks 7-9)

- Core formulas: Z-transform role, unit-circle stability, state-space form
- Core intuition: sampled-data effects, why states are "memory"
- Common traps: mixing $s$ and $z$ tools, ignoring ZOH effects

## Sheet D (Weeks 10-13)

- Core formulas: exact discretization ($A_d,B_d$), controllability/observability tests,
  observer error dynamics, LQR cost
- Core intuition: feasibility before design, optimization vs pole placement
- Common traps: assuming controllability, arbitrary weight tuning

## How to use each sheet

1. Rewrite formulas from memory.
2. Solve one problem per trap type.
3. Do 3 oral prompts from [60-Second Oral Prompts](/practice/oral-exam-prompts).
