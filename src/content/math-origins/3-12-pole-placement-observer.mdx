# 3.12 Math Origin - Pole Placement and Observer Design

## What question creates this math?

How do we force desired dynamic speed/damping when full state is not directly measured?

## Pole-placement controller origin

With state feedback:

$$
u = -Kx + Nr
$$

closed-loop dynamics become:

$$
\dot{x}=(A-BK)x + BNr
$$

So choosing $K$ is equivalent to choosing eigenvalues of $(A-BK)$.

If system is controllable, these poles can be assigned to desired locations.

## Observer origin

When only output is measured:

$$
y=Cx
$$

build estimator:

$$
\dot{\hat{x}} = A\hat{x}+Bu+L(y-C\hat{x})
$$

Estimation error $e_x=x-\hat{x}$ follows:

$$
\dot{e}_x = (A-LC)e_x
$$

So $L$ sets observer poles via eigenvalues of $(A-LC)$.

## Why observer poles are usually faster

If observer is too slow, estimated state lags true state and feedback quality degrades.
Common practice places observer poles 2x to 5x faster than controller poles, balancing convergence and noise sensitivity.

## Separation principle origin

Combined dynamics matrix becomes block upper triangular in transformed coordinates, so controller poles and observer poles appear independently in characteristic polynomial.

Hence:

- design $K$ from controllability,
- design $L$ from observability,
- combine safely under LTI assumptions.

## Assumptions

- controllable/observable model,
- reasonably accurate linearization,
- sensor noise not dominating fast observer dynamics.

## Common mistakes

- Choosing very fast observer poles that amplify noise severely.
- Ignoring actuator limits while placing very aggressive controller poles.
- Forgetting reference prefilter/scaling when evaluating tracking.
