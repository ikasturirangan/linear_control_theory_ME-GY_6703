# 3.7 Math Origin - Jury, Sampled-Data, and Z-Transform

## What question creates this math?

After sampling, what replaces Laplace-domain tools for solving dynamics and testing stability?

## Why Z-transform exists

Discrete sequences need a transform where time shifts become algebraic multiplication.
For sequence $x[k]$:

$$
X(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x[k] z^{-k}
$$

Then one-step shift maps to multiplication by $z^{-1}$, making recursions solvable as algebraic equations.

## Stability geometry change

Continuous-time stability: poles in left half-plane.
Discrete-time stability: poles inside unit circle.

Reason: sampled response contains terms $\lambda^k$.
Decay requires $|\lambda|<1$.

## Why Jury test appears

Jury test is a coefficient-table method for checking whether all roots of a polynomial lie inside unit circle, without solving roots explicitly.
It plays the same role in discrete time that Routh plays in continuous time.

## Sampled-data origin

A sampled-data loop contains:

- sampler (continuous to sequence),
- digital controller,
- hold (sequence to piecewise-constant input),
- continuous plant.

Math appears hybrid because both $s$ and $z$ descriptions are needed.

## Key bridge intuition

- Laplace + Routh for continuous models,
- Z-transform + Jury for discrete models.

Same stability idea, different coordinate system.

## Assumptions

- linear sampled model,
- fixed sample period,
- no severe quantization/saturation effects in first analysis.

## Common mistakes

- Mixing $s$ and $z$ formulas in one step.
- Misinterpreting unit-circle condition as "real part < 0".
- Omitting hold dynamics when connecting digital controller to plant.
