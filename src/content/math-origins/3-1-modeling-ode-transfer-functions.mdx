# 3.1 Math Origin - Modeling, ODE, and Transfer Functions

## What question creates this math?

Given a real system, how do we write equations that predict output from input?

## Where the equation starts

All modeling starts from conservation laws:

- Newton/Euler for mechanics,
- Kirchhoff laws for circuits,
- mass/energy balance for fluids and thermal systems.

These laws naturally produce differential equations because stored energy changes over time.

## Derivation path

1. Define state variable(s) and measured output.
2. Apply balance law to write time-domain ODE.
3. Choose input $u(t)$ and output $y(t)$ explicitly.
4. Apply Laplace transform with zero initial conditions.
5. Rearrange to get $G(s)=Y(s)/U(s)$.

## Generic ODE form

$$
a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_0 y = b_m u^{(m)} + \cdots + b_0 u
$$

Laplace (zero initial conditions):

$$
(a_n s^n + \cdots + a_0)Y(s) = (b_m s^m + \cdots + b_0)U(s)
$$

So:

$$
G(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{b_m s^m + \cdots + b_0}{a_n s^n + \cdots + a_0}
$$

## Why command and disturbance become separate transfer functions

If both reference command and disturbance affect output, linearity lets us separate paths:

$$
Y(s)=T_r(s)R(s)+T_d(s)D(s)
$$

This is superposition: each input has its own transfer path to output.

## Assumptions behind this math

- model is linear in operating region,
- parameters are time-invariant,
- initial conditions are set to zero for TF definition,
- system is causal and physically realizable.

## How to sanity-check your derivation

- Degree of denominator should match dynamic order.
- Units should match on both sides of ODE.
- Poles should match expected physical speed/damping trend.
- $G(0)$ should match steady gain intuition.

## Common mistakes

- Forgetting to define output as sensor-measured quantity.
- Mixing disturbance and command into one unlabeled input.
- Dropping initial-condition terms without stating assumption.
- Algebra sign errors when moving terms before taking ratio.
