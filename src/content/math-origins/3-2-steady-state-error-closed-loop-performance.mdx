# 3.2 Math Origin - Steady-State Error and Closed-Loop Performance

## What question creates this math?

After feedback is added, how close does output get to the target, and how fast/smooth is the response?

## Closed-loop formula origin

Start with negative feedback:

$$
E(s)=R(s)-Y(s), \quad Y(s)=G(s)C(s)E(s)
$$

Substitute and solve for $Y/R$:

$$
Y = GC(R-Y) \Rightarrow Y(1+GC)=GCR
$$

$$
T(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\frac{G(s)C(s)}{1+G(s)C(s)}
$$

This comes directly from signal relations at the summing node.

## Error transfer function origin

From $E=R-Y$ and $Y=TR$:

$$
E=R-TR = (1-T)R
$$

So:

$$
\frac{E(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{1}{1+G(s)C(s)}
$$

This is sensitivity to reference.

## Why final value theorem appears

Steady-state error is limit as $t \to \infty$, and Laplace gives:

$$
e_{ss}=\lim_{t\to\infty} e(t)=\lim_{s\to 0} sE(s)
$$

when all poles of $sE(s)$ are in left half-plane (except possible pole at origin).

## Where system type comes from

For unity feedback, low-frequency behavior of open-loop $L(s)=G(s)C(s)$ dominates SSE.
Number of integrators in $L(s)$ at origin defines system type.

- Type 0: finite step error.
- Type 1: zero step error, finite ramp error.
- Type 2: zero step and ramp error, finite parabolic error.

These are direct consequences of $s \to 0$ limits.

## Performance-metric math origin

Second-order template:

$$
\frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s+\omega_n^2}
$$

Approximate formulas for overshoot/settling/rise come from solving this ODE exactly or by envelope approximation.

## Assumptions

- linear closed loop,
- stable for final-value theorem use,
- dominant second-order approximation when using textbook transient formulas.

## Common mistakes

- Using final value theorem on unstable system.
- Counting poles instead of integrators at origin for type.
- Applying second-order formulas to strongly non-dominant higher-order systems.

## Physical interpretation

Translate the final equations into plain language before moving on:
what physical quantity is changing, what drives it, and what limits the model assumptions.

## When this formula fails

- If assumptions (linearity, operating region, or model fidelity) are violated, prediction quality drops.
- Strong saturation, delay, or unmodeled dynamics can invalidate direct formula use.

## Dimensional/unit check

Before finalizing derivations, verify units on both sides of each equation and confirm coefficient dimensions are physically consistent.
