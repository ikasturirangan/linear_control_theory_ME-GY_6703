# 3.11 Math Origin - Controllability, Observability, Ackermann

## What question creates this math?

Can input move every dynamic mode, and can output measurements reveal every mode?

## Controllability matrix origin

For $\dot{x}=Ax+Bu$, repeated dynamics under input produce directions:

$$
B,\ AB,\ A^2B,\ \ldots,\ A^{n-1}B
$$

Stacking these gives controllability matrix:

$$
\mathcal{C}=[B\ AB\ A^2B\ \cdots\ A^{n-1}B]
$$

If rank is $n$, all state directions are reachable.

## Observability matrix origin

Output derivatives include terms with $C,CA,CA^2,\ldots$.
Stacking gives:

$$
\mathcal{O}=\begin{bmatrix}C\\CA\\CA^2\\\vdots\\CA^{n-1}\end{bmatrix}
$$

If rank is $n$, all states are inferable from output history.

## Why Ackermann formula works (SISO)

For controllable pair $(A,B)$, state feedback $u=-Kx$ can place closed-loop polynomial arbitrarily.
Ackermann provides direct computation:

$$
K = e_n^T\mathcal{C}^{-1}\phi(A)
$$

where $\phi(A)$ is desired characteristic polynomial evaluated at $A$.

This works because controllable canonical structure guarantees independent coefficient shaping.

## Assumptions

- exact linear model,
- full state available for feedback (or observer used),
- SISO and controllable for direct Ackermann formula.

## Common mistakes

- Using numerical rank without tolerance reasoning.
- Applying Ackermann to uncontrollable system.
- Confusing observability with ability to physically measure each state directly.

## Physical interpretation

Translate the final equations into plain language before moving on:
what physical quantity is changing, what drives it, and what limits the model assumptions.

## When this formula fails

- If assumptions (linearity, operating region, or model fidelity) are violated, prediction quality drops.
- Strong saturation, delay, or unmodeled dynamics can invalidate direct formula use.

## Dimensional/unit check

Before finalizing derivations, verify units on both sides of each equation and confirm coefficient dimensions are physically consistent.
