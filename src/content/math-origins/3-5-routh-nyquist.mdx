# 3.5 Math Origin - Routh and Nyquist

## What question creates this math?

Can we determine closed-loop stability without explicitly solving all roots of the characteristic equation?

## Routh origin (algebraic route)

Characteristic polynomial:

$$
a_n s^n + a_{n-1}s^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 = 0
$$

Routh array is built from polynomial coefficients so the first-column sign pattern encodes number of right-half-plane roots.

Key result:

- Number of sign changes in first column = number of RHP roots.

This comes from Cauchy index/continued-fraction reasoning behind the Routh-Hurwitz theorem.

## Why zero first-column entries are special

A zero entry breaks ratio computations in table recursion and indicates boundary/symmetric root scenarios.
Special handling (epsilon method or auxiliary polynomial) restores valid count.

## Nyquist origin (complex-analysis route)

Closed-loop poles are zeros of $1+L(s)$.
Nyquist maps contour in $s$-plane through function $1+L(s)$ and uses argument principle:

- change in argument around contour relates zeros minus poles inside contour.

This gives:

$$
N = Z - P
$$

where:

- $N$: clockwise encirclements of $-1$ by $L(j\omega)$,
- $P$: open-loop RHP poles of $L$,
- $Z$: closed-loop RHP poles.

For stability, require $Z=0$.

## Why both methods answer same question

- Routh inspects polynomial coefficients directly.
- Nyquist inspects loop frequency geometry.

Both count unstable closed-loop poles through different math machinery.

## Assumptions

- proper contour handling for poles on imaginary axis,
- accurate open-loop model,
- characteristic equation correctly formed.

## Common mistakes

- Using wrong characteristic polynomial for Routh.
- Ignoring open-loop unstable poles in Nyquist count.
- Misreading encirclement direction.

## Physical interpretation

Translate the final equations into plain language before moving on:
what physical quantity is changing, what drives it, and what limits the model assumptions.

## When this formula fails

- If assumptions (linearity, operating region, or model fidelity) are violated, prediction quality drops.
- Strong saturation, delay, or unmodeled dynamics can invalidate direct formula use.

## Dimensional/unit check

Before finalizing derivations, verify units on both sides of each equation and confirm coefficient dimensions are physically consistent.
