# 3.3 Math Origin - Bode and Relative Stability

## What question creates this math?

Instead of only asking stable/unstable, how much uncertainty can the loop tolerate before instability?

## Why evaluate at $s=j\omega$

For sinusoidal input $u(t)=A\sin(\omega t)$, LTI systems respond at same frequency with scaled amplitude and phase shift.
That response is encoded by evaluating transfer function on imaginary axis:

$$
G(j\omega)
$$

## Why Bode magnitude uses decibels

Multiplication of gains becomes addition in log scale:

$$
20\log_{10}|G_1G_2| = 20\log_{10}|G_1| + 20\log_{10}|G_2|
$$

This makes hand sketching and loop-shaping practical.

## Why phase matters near crossover

Closed-loop denominator is $1+L(j\omega)$ where $L=GC$.
If $L(j\omega)$ is near $-1+j0$, denominator is near zero and response can become very large/unstable.

So at frequency where $|L|=1$ (0 dB), phase proximity to $-180^\circ$ is critical.

## Margin definitions from geometry

Gain crossover frequency:

$$
|L(j\omega_{gc})|=1
$$

Phase margin:

$$
PM = 180^\circ + \angle L(j\omega_{gc})
$$

Phase crossover frequency:

$$
\angle L(j\omega_{pc})=-180^\circ
$$

Gain margin:

$$
GM = \frac{1}{|L(j\omega_{pc})|}
$$

All are distances from critical instability condition.

## Why this links to damping and overshoot

For many minimum-phase loops, larger PM usually means better damping, hence lower overshoot.
This is an empirical/approximate bridge from frequency domain to time domain.

## Assumptions and limits

- LTI model around operating point,
- margin-to-overshoot mapping is approximate,
- non-minimum-phase zeros or delays can distort simple rules.

## Common mistakes

- Reading margins from closed-loop Bode instead of open-loop loop transfer.
- Ignoring phase unwrap/sign convention.
- Treating PM thresholds as universal for all systems.

## Physical interpretation

Translate the final equations into plain language before moving on:
what physical quantity is changing, what drives it, and what limits the model assumptions.

## When this formula fails

- If assumptions (linearity, operating region, or model fidelity) are violated, prediction quality drops.
- Strong saturation, delay, or unmodeled dynamics can invalidate direct formula use.

## Dimensional/unit check

Before finalizing derivations, verify units on both sides of each equation and confirm coefficient dimensions are physically consistent.
