description: A derivation-first companion that explains how each topic's equations are formed and why the math looks the way it does.

# Math Origins Companion

This section answers a core beginner question:
"Where did this equation come from?"

Each page mirrors one syllabus module and walks from:

1. physical or geometric idea,
2. assumptions,
3. derivation path,
4. interpretation of the final equation.

## How to use this section

- Read the main syllabus page first for intuition and goals.
- Open the matching Math Origins page to understand derivation logic.
- Re-derive one equation by hand before moving on.

## Study rule

If you cannot explain where a formula came from in plain language,
you should not memorize it yet.
