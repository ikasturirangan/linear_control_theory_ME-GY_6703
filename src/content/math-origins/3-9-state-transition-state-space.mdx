# 3.9 Math Origin - State Transition and State-Space

## What question creates this math?

For multi-variable or higher-order systems, how do we represent dynamics compactly and systematically?

## Why state-space form exists

High-order ODEs can be rewritten as first-order vector system:

$$
\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t), \quad y(t)=Cx(t)+Du(t)
$$

State vector $x$ stores minimal memory needed to predict future behavior.

## Where state-transition matrix comes from

For zero input:

$$
\dot{x}=Ax
$$

solution is:

$$
x(t)=e^{At}x(0)
$$

where matrix exponential is defined by series:

$$
e^{At}=I+At+\frac{(At)^2}{2!}+\cdots
$$

This is direct matrix analog of scalar $e^{at}$ solution.

## Full forced solution origin

Using variation of constants:

$$
x(t)=e^{At}x(0)+\int_0^t e^{A(t-\tau)}Bu(\tau)\,d\tau
$$

This separates natural response and input-forced response.

## Why this representation is powerful

- naturally handles MIMO systems,
- links directly to controllability/observability tests,
- supports modern design (LQR, observers, MPC).

## Assumptions

- linearized or linear model,
- known matrices around operating point,
- measurable or estimable states for feedback implementation.

## Common mistakes

- Confusing state variables with outputs.
- Forgetting dimensions when multiplying matrices.
- Treating $e^{At}$ as elementwise exponential.

## Physical interpretation

Translate the final equations into plain language before moving on:
what physical quantity is changing, what drives it, and what limits the model assumptions.

## When this formula fails

- If assumptions (linearity, operating region, or model fidelity) are violated, prediction quality drops.
- Strong saturation, delay, or unmodeled dynamics can invalidate direct formula use.

## Dimensional/unit check

Before finalizing derivations, verify units on both sides of each equation and confirm coefficient dimensions are physically consistent.
