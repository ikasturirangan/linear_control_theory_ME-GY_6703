# 3.8 Math Origin - Sampling, ZOH, A/D, and D/A

## What question creates this math?

How does continuous physics become a sampled model that can be controlled by software?

## Sampling origin

A/D conversion samples continuous signal at $t=kT_s$:

$$
x[k]=x(kT_s)
$$

This is not just notation; it changes what frequencies can be represented.

## Why Nyquist-Shannon condition appears

To avoid aliasing, sample frequency must exceed twice highest signal frequency content:

$$
f_s > 2 f_{max}
$$

This comes from spectrum replication in sampled signals.

## ZOH origin

D/A with zero-order hold keeps each command constant for one sample interval:

$$
u(t)=u[k], \quad kT_s \le t < (k+1)T_s
$$

So plant sees staircase input, not ideal continuous command.

Equivalent hold transfer in continuous domain:

$$
H_{zoh}(s)=\frac{1-e^{-sT_s}}{s}
$$

This factor contributes phase lag and can reduce margin.

## Why sampled plant model differs from continuous model

Discrete plant model already includes sample-and-hold effect.
It is not just "replace $s$ by something" blindly; exact conversion integrates dynamics over each hold interval.

## Quantization origin

A/D maps real-valued signal to finite levels:

$$
q[k]=x[k]+e_q[k]
$$

where $e_q$ is quantization error, often modeled as bounded or noise-like for analysis.

## Assumptions

- anti-alias filtering before A/D,
- synchronized sampling/actuation clocks,
- sufficiently small sample period relative to loop bandwidth.

## Common mistakes

- Ignoring ZOH phase lag in fast loops.
- Choosing $T_s$ too large from computational convenience only.
- Forgetting anti-aliasing and then trusting noisy sampled data.
