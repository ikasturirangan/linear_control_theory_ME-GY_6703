# 3.10 Math Origin - Continuous-to-Discrete and DTSS

## What question creates this math?

Given continuous model $(A,B,C,D)$ and sample period $T_s$, what exact discrete model governs $x[k]$?

## Starting point

Continuous model:

$$
\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t)
$$

With zero-order hold, input is constant within each interval: $u(t)=u[k]$ for $kT_s \le t < (k+1)T_s$.

## Exact discrete derivation

Evaluate state one sample later:

$$
x((k+1)T_s)=e^{AT_s}x(kT_s)+\int_0^{T_s} e^{A\tau}B\,d\tau\,u[k]
$$

Define:

$$
A_d=e^{AT_s}, \quad B_d=\int_0^{T_s} e^{A\tau}B\,d\tau
$$

Then:

$$
x[k+1]=A_d x[k]+B_d u[k]
$$

and output equation remains:

$$
y[k]=Cx[k]+Du[k]
$$

(for sample-at-output convention).

## Why this matters

This is the exact bridge between continuous physics and digital implementation under ZOH, not an approximation by default.

## Approximation alternatives

Forward Euler, backward Euler, and Tustin are numerical approximations used when exact matrix exponential conversion is not preferred.

## Assumptions

- ZOH input behavior,
- fixed sampling period,
- linear model valid over each interval.

## Common mistakes

- Using $A_d=I+AT_s$ as if always exact.
- Ignoring that $B_d$ is integral, not simply $BT_s$ in general.
- Converting $A$ but forgetting consistent conversion of $B$.

## Physical interpretation

Translate the final equations into plain language before moving on:
what physical quantity is changing, what drives it, and what limits the model assumptions.

## When this formula fails

- If assumptions (linearity, operating region, or model fidelity) are violated, prediction quality drops.
- Strong saturation, delay, or unmodeled dynamics can invalidate direct formula use.

## Dimensional/unit check

Before finalizing derivations, verify units on both sides of each equation and confirm coefficient dimensions are physically consistent.
